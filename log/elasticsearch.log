On the outside she looks like the picture of perfect health, and she has the most gorgeous clear sun kissed skin Ive ever seen. I know it was hard for her to tell me. After she told me she explained to me about all of the medications she has to take in a day, her vest and nebulizer treatments, digestive issues, etc... Ive begun to spend more time with her in private as now that shes told me she feels more comfortable with that whole aspect. And with that Ive really begun to see how this affects her life everyday. But since its all new to me I honestly dont know how to react to what I see. Im not really sure whether to offer to help her with treatments, act more concerned and be extra caring and attentive, or just go on as normal, like I was before she told me, and not do anything. What should I do? Has anyone else here had any similar experiences in their relationship?<br> <br> Thanks, <br> Aaron ","thread_id":15549}'

I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there.

He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her.

He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word).

That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,.

If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available.

Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut.

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in.

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month.

Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off.

But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself.

He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her.

Thank God my TX Doc called today &amp, told me the problem can be controlled with a new med. Anyway, thats my story &amp, Im sticking to it. Thanks for reading my rambling statement... Pat.

He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word).

GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know.

If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on.

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in.

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. ","thread_id":1032}'

Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me.

Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off.

It seems that he sees himself as invincible, and because of this he doesnt do his treatments, or does them sporadically. <br> One of the biggest issues right now is that he is 18, so he cannot be forced to be hospitalized or to do his treatments. He moved out and is living with his girlfriend. He dropped out of college. It just seems like he is giving up. <br> At his visit with his doctor today he was told that his numbers are so bad that he is a candidate for the transplant list - but that because he doesnt do his treatments, they wouldnt give him the transplant. My sister-in-law is devastated, but is at a total loss about what to do. <br> <br> <br> We are all so worried.

But, she was from a smoking generation, married to a smoker and too soon she was smoking again. During a visit at our non smoking house, she being the exception, I asked her why she started smoking again. It was the pressure and the absolute denial over it killing her. And she said as much. I directly asked her to try to stop again for good. She rather fatalistically asked me why it should matter. Blubber, blubber, I melted and told her I would like to have a mother around as long as possible. She stopped.

She did take it down, but apparently her feelings were very hurt. I was actually the one questioned by my family. I felt like I was the one being attacked. I was made to feel like I was ashamed of my child for having CF and what was wrong with me. I was told that CF wasnt something you could hide. My husband and I have an agreement, dont hide it, be open about it, but dont announce it on public forums like Facebook. I think we have a pretty healthy approach to it. I want by child to be open about CF but I know that one day he will be a teenager and I dont want to take away all of his choices. He may choose to first let people get to know him, and then tell him has CF later or whatever he chooses. I know how difficult it is to be a teenager. The thing is, we live in such a small town, I know everyone will know, and we have to teach him just to say, &quot,Yeah, I have CF, but its okay.&quot, But I also dont think we should announce it publicly.

And I would have to agree with your family about this. You should want people to know about your sons CF so they may pray for him! Having CF is most certainly something that you cant hide and by asking her to take it off Facebook is acting like you are ashamed that your son has CF as people have said to you already. It could also send the wrong message to your son when he is old enough to understand his situation. I know you think you are protecting him by this behavior but in the future this behavior will only hinder him. If you act like CF should be hidden it gives him the message that he has a weakness that should be hidden from the world and that WILL make him weak. He may start withdrawing from social events because he feels like he should be ashamed of his CF instead of embracing it and taking charge of it. You want him to be able to say to people who question it, &quot,Yeah, I have CF...sooo?&quot, Now Im not saying you should tell every single person you come in contact with but the more prayers he has the better off he is! The thing that baffles me about normal people is that they act like just because we have a disease we are some kind of deformed creature that needs to wear a &quot,normal&quot, mask to hide the ugliness within us. You need to teach your son that he is NORMAL and that having to do breathing treatments and take lots of meds just helps him to live a normal life. As a child growing up with CF I was never allowed to use CF as an excuse. I was expected to be like every other kid out there and I was expected to get good grades and do my chores, etc. My parents wouldnt even allow me to file with Students with Disabilities in college because that would allow me to be weak if and when I chose to be. Teach your son that CF is not a disability, CF is just a challenge that you have to overcome. As a kid I always thought that my parents were hard on me but now I am soooo thankful they were like that because they have taught me to be tough. CF is not my defining characteristic...I am a geologist by education, a Seismic Data Specialist by occupation, a wife, a homeowner, and a mother to two furry kids...but I just happen to have CF. That is what you want for your son! Thats what you need to focus on... not what somebody posted on Facebook. Nobody should be ashamed of CF, CF is not some poor life decision we made that we have to live with now, its just the cards we were dealt. The &quot,cards&quot, of CF is not what defines us...what does define us is how we choose to play the game of life, fold or go all in!! Good luck with your son and please dont ever let CF define who he is! Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of CF, and PLEASE dont let your son be either! Having this mentality now will only make him feel uncomfortable in social or public situations down the road. ","thread_id":12105}'

The MMR collects applications and fees for people wanting to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, processes the applications and in return the send MMR cards or &#8220,Red Cards&#8221, to the patients. With this MMR card you can go to any MM dispensary in your state and purchase medical cannabis and MM products such as edibles or tinctures.<br> <br> To obtain a MMR card you need to visit a dispensary or three in your area. They should have several advertisements for medical doctors specializing in MM evaluations. The main reason your pediatrician or adult CF specialist doesn&#8217,t perform MM evaluations as well as treat your other CF issues has to do with looming Federal laws that could befall any doctor. A MM evaluation in most cases involves a cursory physical exam, a MM evaluation* and all the paperwork to obtain your MMR or whatever they call it in NJ. In summary, see a doctor that does MMR or MM evaluations, send in the paperwork from the doctor that includes your evaluation, application, copy of current ID etc. along with the State fee and wait for the mail.<br> <br> *MMR evaluation for anybody with documented medical issues is very straight forward. We are why this law happened so don&#8217,t worry about big brother here. A copy of a recent CF clinic evaluation that usually notes the particulars like &#8220,CF, DLT, CFRD etc., along with a sweat test or genetic test and a blood test or such is more than plenty. The actual medical marijuana evaluation won&#8217,t involve more than a fifteen minute visit with the doctor. During that time plus some of the time waiting for the doctor will be spent with office staff double checking applications, getting ID&#8217,s copied and in general making certain if you can affix a stamp to an envelope, you&#8217,re in.<br> <br> I haven&#8217,t started going through rmotion&#8217,s links but my guess is you will find out far more than you need to know about MM choices and their effects. I have written on this topic before and my first personal rule is to keep my doctors on board and informed about anything outside the prescribed course of my treatment. Your doctor may not be thrilled over MM because like every natural medicine, science and fact are not mandatory like prescription drugs. <br> I haven&#8217,t had time to look this over but Leafly.com is a source of various MM strains with some description of content, treatments etc. Otherwise you are back in trial and error like sooo many medicines before. Hybrids are best to start with. Sativa or sativa dominant cannabis contains the highest levels of THC the main psychoactive drug. The rope industry developed Indica which has little THC but higher percentages of CBD&#8217,s. Hybrids are Sativa-Indica combinations like roses. You have more than most people can count.<br> <br> Delivery is very important. I recommend vaporizing. A decent vaporizer like Vapir NO2 is available for around $180. It is a digitally controlled heat chamber that once set about 360 degrees F. you are in business.

I LOVE what I do and I have a lot of flexibility with my schedule and I am able to work from home when needed. My education is in nursing and business, but I took a liking to computers when I started working, so I just fell in love with this career. As of right now, I am not finding it to be difficult to balance work and CF because I stay strict with my routine and make time for everything I need to do. I also find that being at work makes me feel better because I am around people and fulfilling my social needs, as well as contributing my skills to something important. <br> <br> Obviously, it takes time to develop a good relationship with your boss. But I have found that if you are a hard worker and prove yourself early on, that most bosses will work with you in return and allow some flexibility. I try to take days off for clinic appointments when I know I am not needed at work that day and when my work is caught up, I try not to inconvenience my coworkers or boss. However, I have also been hospitalized for a bowel obstruction unexpectedly, and that was not in my control. But because I kept my boss up to date with my status and my expected day of return, it all worked out just fine. But that is the best advice I can give - is be an over-the-top, hard worker and prove that you are there to do a good job and good things will come in return.<br> <br> As I said above, keeping a strict routine is key for me too. I am not post-transplant, so obviously my routine has nebs, CPT, etc. But Im sure your routine has to be more strict on things like eating regularly and taking your meds on time. So it may be wise to find a job that allows you to have the same scheduled hours so that you can stick more to a routine. I have found that when my hours varied (i.e. Monday was 7am-3pm, then Tuesday was 12-8pm), I was out of whack and I slacked on my CF stuff. Some people can deal with the awkward schedules, but I have found that it makes it easier for me because of all the maintenance required.<br> <br> Some other advice I have is not to disclose your CF right away to your boss. I often start off by asking for days off for appointments by just requesting a planned sick dayvacation day. Again, prove yourself. But also allow yourself the time you need to take care of your CF. If your boss mentions that you are excessively requesting time off, then that is a good time to explain in a sincere way that you are there to do a good job but that you have some health issues that need some attention from time to time. And just let the conversations roll from there. One job I had, I told my boss about my CF about 6 months in. Ironically her cousin who was very close to her also had CF, and this boss ended up being one of my best friends. We had such a good relationship inside and outside of our job because of my honesty and hard work.<br> <br> Life is too short to do something that doesnt make you happy. You need to enjoy going to work and using the skills that you have. Pick something that makes you smile, isnt too stressful, and makes you feel good at the end of the day. There are so many good things that can come out of going back to work, so good luck! ","thread_id":4637}'

If your clients are sick most all business can be taken care of over an email or phone call. It has been the perfect solution for me.

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) ","thread_id":14731}'

We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time.

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ","thread_id":12928}'

It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in.

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. ","thread_id":1032}'

Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future.

The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,.

I too watch my DS not do his treatments like he should. I also know the heartache it causes me. The CFF has a section about anxiety and depression. They note that teenagers and young adults are most at risk for having symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with younger children (under the age of 12) or adults over the age of 30. It also says that people who are depressed or anxious may have trouble focusing and remembering to do their treatments or may feel hopeless and think that doing their treatments will not help and they may stop doing them. Perhaps if your nephews family could convince him to be seen and put on an antidepressant this would help him to want to take care of himself. I wish the best for your nephew. I will have him in my prayers. ","thread_id":10188}'

But, she was from a smoking generation, married to a smoker and too soon she was smoking again. During a visit at our non smoking house, she being the exception, I asked her why she started smoking again. It was the pressure and the absolute denial over it killing her. And she said as much. I directly asked her to try to stop again for good. She rather fatalistically asked me why it should matter. Blubber, blubber, I melted and told her I would like to have a mother around as long as possible. She stopped.

And I would have to agree with your family about this. You should want people to know about your sons CF so they may pray for him! Having CF is most certainly something that you cant hide and by asking her to take it off Facebook is acting like you are ashamed that your son has CF as people have said to you already. It could also send the wrong message to your son when he is old enough to understand his situation. I know you think you are protecting him by this behavior but in the future this behavior will only hinder him. If you act like CF should be hidden it gives him the message that he has a weakness that should be hidden from the world and that WILL make him weak. He may start withdrawing from social events because he feels like he should be ashamed of his CF instead of embracing it and taking charge of it. You want him to be able to say to people who question it, &quot,Yeah, I have CF...sooo?&quot, Now Im not saying you should tell every single person you come in contact with but the more prayers he has the better off he is! The thing that baffles me about normal people is that they act like just because we have a disease we are some kind of deformed creature that needs to wear a &quot,normal&quot, mask to hide the ugliness within us. You need to teach your son that he is NORMAL and that having to do breathing treatments and take lots of meds just helps him to live a normal life. As a child growing up with CF I was never allowed to use CF as an excuse. I was expected to be like every other kid out there and I was expected to get good grades and do my chores, etc. My parents wouldnt even allow me to file with Students with Disabilities in college because that would allow me to be weak if and when I chose to be. Teach your son that CF is not a disability, CF is just a challenge that you have to overcome. As a kid I always thought that my parents were hard on me but now I am soooo thankful they were like that because they have taught me to be tough. CF is not my defining characteristic...I am a geologist by education, a Seismic Data Specialist by occupation, a wife, a homeowner, and a mother to two furry kids...but I just happen to have CF. That is what you want for your son! Thats what you need to focus on... not what somebody posted on Facebook. Nobody should be ashamed of CF, CF is not some poor life decision we made that we have to live with now, its just the cards we were dealt. The &quot,cards&quot, of CF is not what defines us...what does define us is how we choose to play the game of life, fold or go all in!! Good luck with your son and please dont ever let CF define who he is! Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of CF, and PLEASE dont let your son be either! Having this mentality now will only make him feel uncomfortable in social or public situations down the road. ","thread_id":12105}'

Nothing that I know of, all it takes is an email address and BOOM, youre on a social media website, much like this one... Even though this website is designed for a special cause it is still a SOCIAL MEDIA website and as Melissa75 stated...nothing is truly deletable. ","thread_id":12105}'

We dont do Facebook though so that helps.

She took a picture from my Facebook page and tacked on some medical information. Fine to take the picture, which was already there, but not the medical information. We pray for my son, but with close personal friends, and believe me God hears that without it being announced on a social media webpages. Its funny, just last year when I wanted to send a letter home in preschool explaining what CF was, I was criticized by CF adults who asked me why I would do that to my child? That is what made me reevaluate how I would approach it. Openness, not hiding anything, and pride in our struggles - perfect...but announcing on Facebook and other public forums - something we just wouldnt do. My little boy knows how proud I am, and he knows I am so proud of him for fighting CF....dont worry, Aggie, there is no shame involved here and he is being raised to be proud of everything he is and has to go through.

The MMR collects applications and fees for people wanting to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, processes the applications and in return the send MMR cards or &#8220,Red Cards&#8221, to the patients. With this MMR card you can go to any MM dispensary in your state and purchase medical cannabis and MM products such as edibles or tinctures.<br> <br> To obtain a MMR card you need to visit a dispensary or three in your area. They should have several advertisements for medical doctors specializing in MM evaluations. The main reason your pediatrician or adult CF specialist doesn&#8217,t perform MM evaluations as well as treat your other CF issues has to do with looming Federal laws that could befall any doctor. A MM evaluation in most cases involves a cursory physical exam, a MM evaluation* and all the paperwork to obtain your MMR or whatever they call it in NJ. In summary, see a doctor that does MMR or MM evaluations, send in the paperwork from the doctor that includes your evaluation, application, copy of current ID etc. along with the State fee and wait for the mail.<br> <br> *MMR evaluation for anybody with documented medical issues is very straight forward. We are why this law happened so don&#8217,t worry about big brother here. A copy of a recent CF clinic evaluation that usually notes the particulars like &#8220,CF, DLT, CFRD etc., along with a sweat test or genetic test and a blood test or such is more than plenty. The actual medical marijuana evaluation won&#8217,t involve more than a fifteen minute visit with the doctor. During that time plus some of the time waiting for the doctor will be spent with office staff double checking applications, getting ID&#8217,s copied and in general making certain if you can affix a stamp to an envelope, you&#8217,re in.<br> <br> I haven&#8217,t started going through rmotion&#8217,s links but my guess is you will find out far more than you need to know about MM choices and their effects. I have written on this topic before and my first personal rule is to keep my doctors on board and informed about anything outside the prescribed course of my treatment. Your doctor may not be thrilled over MM because like every natural medicine, science and fact are not mandatory like prescription drugs. <br> I haven&#8217,t had time to look this over but Leafly.com is a source of various MM strains with some description of content, treatments etc. Otherwise you are back in trial and error like sooo many medicines before. Hybrids are best to start with. Sativa or sativa dominant cannabis contains the highest levels of THC the main psychoactive drug. The rope industry developed Indica which has little THC but higher percentages of CBD&#8217,s. Hybrids are Sativa-Indica combinations like roses. You have more than most people can count.<br> <br> Delivery is very important. I recommend vaporizing. A decent vaporizer like Vapir NO2 is available for around $180. It is a digitally controlled heat chamber that once set about 360 degrees F. you are in business.

I LOVE what I do and I have a lot of flexibility with my schedule and I am able to work from home when needed. My education is in nursing and business, but I took a liking to computers when I started working, so I just fell in love with this career. As of right now, I am not finding it to be difficult to balance work and CF because I stay strict with my routine and make time for everything I need to do. I also find that being at work makes me feel better because I am around people and fulfilling my social needs, as well as contributing my skills to something important. <br> <br> Obviously, it takes time to develop a good relationship with your boss. But I have found that if you are a hard worker and prove yourself early on, that most bosses will work with you in return and allow some flexibility. I try to take days off for clinic appointments when I know I am not needed at work that day and when my work is caught up, I try not to inconvenience my coworkers or boss. However, I have also been hospitalized for a bowel obstruction unexpectedly, and that was not in my control. But because I kept my boss up to date with my status and my expected day of return, it all worked out just fine. But that is the best advice I can give - is be an over-the-top, hard worker and prove that you are there to do a good job and good things will come in return.<br> <br> As I said above, keeping a strict routine is key for me too. I am not post-transplant, so obviously my routine has nebs, CPT, etc. But Im sure your routine has to be more strict on things like eating regularly and taking your meds on time. So it may be wise to find a job that allows you to have the same scheduled hours so that you can stick more to a routine. I have found that when my hours varied (i.e. Monday was 7am-3pm, then Tuesday was 12-8pm), I was out of whack and I slacked on my CF stuff. Some people can deal with the awkward schedules, but I have found that it makes it easier for me because of all the maintenance required.<br> <br> Some other advice I have is not to disclose your CF right away to your boss. I often start off by asking for days off for appointments by just requesting a planned sick dayvacation day. Again, prove yourself. But also allow yourself the time you need to take care of your CF. If your boss mentions that you are excessively requesting time off, then that is a good time to explain in a sincere way that you are there to do a good job but that you have some health issues that need some attention from time to time. And just let the conversations roll from there. One job I had, I told my boss about my CF about 6 months in. Ironically her cousin who was very close to her also had CF, and this boss ended up being one of my best friends. We had such a good relationship inside and outside of our job because of my honesty and hard work.<br> <br> Life is too short to do something that doesnt make you happy. You need to enjoy going to work and using the skills that you have. Pick something that makes you smile, isnt too stressful, and makes you feel good at the end of the day. There are so many good things that can come out of going back to work, so good luck! ","thread_id":4637}'

I get to choose my hours and 85% of the work is done over the phone, email, or paper work that is faxed...which means I get to stay at home a lot. Right now I am on IVs and I stayed in my PJs all day. The only work I had today was all taken care of by phone and emails. Honestly, the only time you have to leave is to show buyers potential property, (if you choose) an open house on Sundays, or a run to the office...obviously every now and then you may need to meet an inspector or worker at a house. However, it has offered me a lot of freedom to do my treatments and rest if I am not feeling well. Also, you are not around a lot of people...that is one of the best parts. You can stay away from the sick during flu season and such. Yes, you will be around your clients but you do not meet with them everyday like in other jobs. If your clients are sick most all business can be taken care of over an email or phone call. It has been the perfect solution for me. Yes, the downside is that it is commission only and in the beginning you will be spending a lot of time in the office and learning from the managers. Once you build up a clientele and really understand the contracts most work can be done from home. ","thread_id":13943}'

I work 980s which yield a long day (Im up at 5am, at work by 6:20am, leave at 4:20pm and home by 5:10ish) but I have every other Friday off which is really nice to catch up on sleep or go to doctor appointments without having to miss work. I would have to say that because I have to leave so early in the morning I do not have time to take my treatments. I usually do my albuterol inhaler to help open up my lungs for the day but I dont do anything else. I do make sure I take a really good treatment when I get home with at least 45 minutes of Vest time though. Luckily, I have stayed pretty healthy...only 2 IV therapy sessions in the past 5 years with my FEV1 at 73%. I wouldnt recommend this type of schedule for someone thats had a transplant or has to do a lot of IV sessions but it has worked for me the past couple years so I am going to rock it out now while I am making awesome money and save up for the time in the future when I wont be able to work this schedule anymore. It is a tough schedule to keep and balancing work with CF and other normal life activities is tiring at times but I just keep pushing forward. I didnt go this far with my life to give up now...if I was to quit, everything I did to get here would be a waste of time and money.

It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline.

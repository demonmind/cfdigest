When I would ask she would just say that she had an ongoing cold and change the subject. She would also excuse herself to the bathroom often (to take her digestive enzymes before meals as I now know). She is very vivacious, sassy, and very active. She goes to college like many young adults (shes 21). She swims, surfs, loves the beach, loves to do yoga. She always likes to eat all the organic and all natural foods and fresh juices. On the outside she looks like the picture of perfect health, and she has the most gorgeous clear sun kissed skin Ive ever seen. I know it was hard for her to tell me. After she told me she explained to me about all of the medications she has to take in a day, her vest and nebulizer treatments, digestive issues, etc... Ive begun to spend more time with her in private as now that shes told me she feels more comfortable with that whole aspect. And with that Ive really begun to see how this affects her life everyday. But since its all new to me I honestly dont know how to react to what I see. Im not really sure whether to offer to help her with treatments, act more concerned and be extra caring and attentive, or just go on as normal, like I was before she told me, and not do anything.

He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it.

I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis.

Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way.

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:39:05', NULL)[0m

Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! ', 9573, '2013-10-05 23:41:15', NULL)

We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time.

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:41:16', NULL)[0m

But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. ', 7536, '2013-10-05 23:41:16', NULL)[0m

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. ', 1032, '2013-10-05 23:41:16', NULL)

Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me.

Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

I dont think it should be about age as much as body size and mass. Lung transplantation is very tricky, much more difficult than a kidney or liver. A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off. Is this case just about age or about the disgraceful lack of organ donors in general? ', 15027, '2013-10-05 23:41:16', NULL)[0m

When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! ', 9573, '2013-10-05 23:42:20', NULL)[0m

I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations.

Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:42:21', NULL)[0m

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:42:21', NULL)

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month.

Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me.

The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default.

She was trim, active and happy but she was dying from congestive heart disease from the first heart attack on.<br> <br> After the heart attack, rehab and quitting smoking, she was healthier than ever. But, she was from a smoking generation, married to a smoker and too soon she was smoking again. During a visit at our non smoking house, she being the exception, I asked her why she started smoking again. It was the pressure and the absolute denial over it killing her. And she said as much. I directly asked her to try to stop again for good. She rather fatalistically asked me why it should matter. Blubber, blubber, I melted and told her I would like to have a mother around as long as possible. She stopped.

And I would have to agree with your family about this. You should want people to know about your sons CF so they may pray for him! Having CF is most certainly something that you cant hide and by asking her to take it off Facebook is acting like you are ashamed that your son has CF as people have said to you already. It could also send the wrong message to your son when he is old enough to understand his situation. I know you think you are protecting him by this behavior but in the future this behavior will only hinder him. If you act like CF should be hidden it gives him the message that he has a weakness that should be hidden from the world and that WILL make him weak. He may start withdrawing from social events because he feels like he should be ashamed of his CF instead of embracing it and taking charge of it. You want him to be able to say to people who question it, &quot,Yeah, I have CF...sooo?&quot, Now Im not saying you should tell every single person you come in contact with but the more prayers he has the better off he is! The thing that baffles me about normal people is that they act like just because we have a disease we are some kind of deformed creature that needs to wear a &quot,normal&quot, mask to hide the ugliness within us. You need to teach your son that he is NORMAL and that having to do breathing treatments and take lots of meds just helps him to live a normal life. As a child growing up with CF I was never allowed to use CF as an excuse. I was expected to be like every other kid out there and I was expected to get good grades and do my chores, etc. My parents wouldnt even allow me to file with Students with Disabilities in college because that would allow me to be weak if and when I chose to be. Teach your son that CF is not a disability, CF is just a challenge that you have to overcome. As a kid I always thought that my parents were hard on me but now I am soooo thankful they were like that because they have taught me to be tough. CF is not my defining characteristic...I am a geologist by education, a Seismic Data Specialist by occupation, a wife, a homeowner, and a mother to two furry kids...but I just happen to have CF. That is what you want for your son! Thats what you need to focus on... not what somebody posted on Facebook. Nobody should be ashamed of CF, CF is not some poor life decision we made that we have to live with now, its just the cards we were dealt. The &quot,cards&quot, of CF is not what defines us...what does define us is how we choose to play the game of life, fold or go all in!! Good luck with your son and please dont ever let CF define who he is! Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of CF, and PLEASE dont let your son be either! Having this mentality now will only make him feel uncomfortable in social or public situations down the road. ', 12105, '2013-10-05 23:42:22', NULL)[0m

The MMR collects applications and fees for people wanting to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, processes the applications and in return the send MMR cards or &#8220,Red Cards&#8221, to the patients. With this MMR card you can go to any MM dispensary in your state and purchase medical cannabis and MM products such as edibles or tinctures.<br> <br> To obtain a MMR card you need to visit a dispensary or three in your area. They should have several advertisements for medical doctors specializing in MM evaluations. The main reason your pediatrician or adult CF specialist doesn&#8217,t perform MM evaluations as well as treat your other CF issues has to do with looming Federal laws that could befall any doctor. A MM evaluation in most cases involves a cursory physical exam, a MM evaluation* and all the paperwork to obtain your MMR or whatever they call it in NJ. In summary, see a doctor that does MMR or MM evaluations, send in the paperwork from the doctor that includes your evaluation, application, copy of current ID etc. along with the State fee and wait for the mail.<br> <br> *MMR evaluation for anybody with documented medical issues is very straight forward. We are why this law happened so don&#8217,t worry about big brother here. A copy of a recent CF clinic evaluation that usually notes the particulars like &#8220,CF, DLT, CFRD etc., along with a sweat test or genetic test and a blood test or such is more than plenty. The actual medical marijuana evaluation won&#8217,t involve more than a fifteen minute visit with the doctor. During that time plus some of the time waiting for the doctor will be spent with office staff double checking applications, getting ID&#8217,s copied and in general making certain if you can affix a stamp to an envelope, you&#8217,re in.<br> <br> I haven&#8217,t started going through rmotion&#8217,s links but my guess is you will find out far more than you need to know about MM choices and their effects. I have written on this topic before and my first personal rule is to keep my doctors on board and informed about anything outside the prescribed course of my treatment. Your doctor may not be thrilled over MM because like every natural medicine, science and fact are not mandatory like prescription drugs. <br> I haven&#8217,t had time to look this over but Leafly.com is a source of various MM strains with some description of content, treatments etc. Otherwise you are back in trial and error like sooo many medicines before. Hybrids are best to start with. Sativa or sativa dominant cannabis contains the highest levels of THC the main psychoactive drug. The rope industry developed Indica which has little THC but higher percentages of CBD&#8217,s. Hybrids are Sativa-Indica combinations like roses. You have more than most people can count.<br> <br> Delivery is very important. I recommend vaporizing. A decent vaporizer like Vapir NO2 is available for around $180. It is a digitally controlled heat chamber that once set about 360 degrees F. you are in business. If you want a whole lot more on the topic, pm me or if all the links here aren&#8217,t enough look back a couple of months when this was a topic.<br> <br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:42:22', NULL)[0m

I LOVE what I do and I have a lot of flexibility with my schedule and I am able to work from home when needed. My education is in nursing and business, but I took a liking to computers when I started working, so I just fell in love with this career. As of right now, I am not finding it to be difficult to balance work and CF because I stay strict with my routine and make time for everything I need to do. I also find that being at work makes me feel better because I am around people and fulfilling my social needs, as well as contributing my skills to something important. <br> <br> Obviously, it takes time to develop a good relationship with your boss. But I have found that if you are a hard worker and prove yourself early on, that most bosses will work with you in return and allow some flexibility. I try to take days off for clinic appointments when I know I am not needed at work that day and when my work is caught up, I try not to inconvenience my coworkers or boss. However, I have also been hospitalized for a bowel obstruction unexpectedly, and that was not in my control. But because I kept my boss up to date with my status and my expected day of return, it all worked out just fine. But that is the best advice I can give - is be an over-the-top, hard worker and prove that you are there to do a good job and good things will come in return.<br> <br> As I said above, keeping a strict routine is key for me too. I am not post-transplant, so obviously my routine has nebs, CPT, etc. But Im sure your routine has to be more strict on things like eating regularly and taking your meds on time. So it may be wise to find a job that allows you to have the same scheduled hours so that you can stick more to a routine. I have found that when my hours varied (i.e. Monday was 7am-3pm, then Tuesday was 12-8pm), I was out of whack and I slacked on my CF stuff. Some people can deal with the awkward schedules, but I have found that it makes it easier for me because of all the maintenance required.<br> <br> Some other advice I have is not to disclose your CF right away to your boss. I often start off by asking for days off for appointments by just requesting a planned sick dayvacation day. Again, prove yourself. But also allow yourself the time you need to take care of your CF. If your boss mentions that you are excessively requesting time off, then that is a good time to explain in a sincere way that you are there to do a good job but that you have some health issues that need some attention from time to time. And just let the conversations roll from there. One job I had, I told my boss about my CF about 6 months in. Ironically her cousin who was very close to her also had CF, and this boss ended up being one of my best friends. We had such a good relationship inside and outside of our job because of my honesty and hard work.<br> <br> Life is too short to do something that doesnt make you happy. You need to enjoy going to work and using the skills that you have. Pick something that makes you smile, isnt too stressful, and makes you feel good at the end of the day. There are so many good things that can come out of going back to work, so good luck! ', 4637, '2013-10-05 23:42:22', NULL)

If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! ', 9573, '2013-10-05 23:45:25', 'WHKCUEVE')[0m

A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. ', 13912, '2013-10-05 23:45:25', 'CNXXMZMW')[0m

As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:45:26', 'PTUFUZMC')

It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in.

I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month.

Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me.

Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

I dont think it should be about age as much as body size and mass. Lung transplantation is very tricky, much more difficult than a kidney or liver. A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off.

It seems that he sees himself as invincible, and because of this he doesnt do his treatments, or does them sporadically. <br> One of the biggest issues right now is that he is 18, so he cannot be forced to be hospitalized or to do his treatments.

She was trim, active and happy but she was dying from congestive heart disease from the first heart attack on.<br> <br> After the heart attack, rehab and quitting smoking, she was healthier than ever. But, she was from a smoking generation, married to a smoker and too soon she was smoking again. During a visit at our non smoking house, she being the exception, I asked her why she started smoking again. It was the pressure and the absolute denial over it killing her. And she said as much. I directly asked her to try to stop again for good. She rather fatalistically asked me why it should matter. Blubber, blubber, I melted and told her I would like to have a mother around as long as possible. She stopped.

I very kindly asked her to please take it down as she has 800 friends and some day my little boy will be a teenager and may not want CF announced. She did take it down, but apparently her feelings were very hurt. I was actually the one questioned by my family. I felt like I was the one being attacked. I was made to feel like I was ashamed of my child for having CF and what was wrong with me. I was told that CF wasnt something you could hide. My husband and I have an agreement, dont hide it, be open about it, but dont announce it on public forums like Facebook. I think we have a pretty healthy approach to it. I want by child to be open about CF but I know that one day he will be a teenager and I dont want to take away all of his choices. He may choose to first let people get to know him, and then tell him has CF later or whatever he chooses. I know how difficult it is to be a teenager. The thing is, we live in such a small town, I know everyone will know, and we have to teach him just to say, &quot,Yeah, I have CF, but its okay.&quot, But I also dont think we should announce it publicly. What are your opinions about this? It has just caused all kinds of bad feelings, and we sure dont need any negative vibes right now. rosesixtyfive, mother of 3 year old boy, ddf508 ', 9895, '2013-10-05 23:45:26', 'SNGBRDDY')[0m

And I would have to agree with your family about this. You should want people to know about your sons CF so they may pray for him! Having CF is most certainly something that you cant hide and by asking her to take it off Facebook is acting like you are ashamed that your son has CF as people have said to you already. It could also send the wrong message to your son when he is old enough to understand his situation. I know you think you are protecting him by this behavior but in the future this behavior will only hinder him. If you act like CF should be hidden it gives him the message that he has a weakness that should be hidden from the world and that WILL make him weak. He may start withdrawing from social events because he feels like he should be ashamed of his CF instead of embracing it and taking charge of it. You want him to be able to say to people who question it, &quot,Yeah, I have CF...sooo?&quot, Now Im not saying you should tell every single person you come in contact with but the more prayers he has the better off he is! The thing that baffles me about normal people is that they act like just because we have a disease we are some kind of deformed creature that needs to wear a &quot,normal&quot, mask to hide the ugliness within us. You need to teach your son that he is NORMAL and that having to do breathing treatments and take lots of meds just helps him to live a normal life. As a child growing up with CF I was never allowed to use CF as an excuse. I was expected to be like every other kid out there and I was expected to get good grades and do my chores, etc. My parents wouldnt even allow me to file with Students with Disabilities in college because that would allow me to be weak if and when I chose to be. Teach your son that CF is not a disability, CF is just a challenge that you have to overcome. As a kid I always thought that my parents were hard on me but now I am soooo thankful they were like that because they have taught me to be tough. CF is not my defining characteristic...I am a geologist by education, a Seismic Data Specialist by occupation, a wife, a homeowner, and a mother to two furry kids...but I just happen to have CF. That is what you want for your son! Thats what you need to focus on... not what somebody posted on Facebook. Nobody should be ashamed of CF, CF is not some poor life decision we made that we have to live with now, its just the cards we were dealt. The &quot,cards&quot, of CF is not what defines us...what does define us is how we choose to play the game of life, fold or go all in!! Good luck with your son and please dont ever let CF define who he is! Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of CF, and PLEASE dont let your son be either! Having this mentality now will only make him feel uncomfortable in social or public situations down the road. ', 12105, '2013-10-05 23:45:26', 'MSYCYFLA')[0m

The MMR collects applications and fees for people wanting to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, processes the applications and in return the send MMR cards or &#8220,Red Cards&#8221, to the patients. With this MMR card you can go to any MM dispensary in your state and purchase medical cannabis and MM products such as edibles or tinctures.<br> <br> To obtain a MMR card you need to visit a dispensary or three in your area. They should have several advertisements for medical doctors specializing in MM evaluations. The main reason your pediatrician or adult CF specialist doesn&#8217,t perform MM evaluations as well as treat your other CF issues has to do with looming Federal laws that could befall any doctor. A MM evaluation in most cases involves a cursory physical exam, a MM evaluation* and all the paperwork to obtain your MMR or whatever they call it in NJ. In summary, see a doctor that does MMR or MM evaluations, send in the paperwork from the doctor that includes your evaluation, application, copy of current ID etc. along with the State fee and wait for the mail.<br> <br> *MMR evaluation for anybody with documented medical issues is very straight forward. We are why this law happened so don&#8217,t worry about big brother here. A copy of a recent CF clinic evaluation that usually notes the particulars like &#8220,CF, DLT, CFRD etc., along with a sweat test or genetic test and a blood test or such is more than plenty. The actual medical marijuana evaluation won&#8217,t involve more than a fifteen minute visit with the doctor. During that time plus some of the time waiting for the doctor will be spent with office staff double checking applications, getting ID&#8217,s copied and in general making certain if you can affix a stamp to an envelope, you&#8217,re in.<br> <br> I haven&#8217,t started going through rmotion&#8217,s links but my guess is you will find out far more than you need to know about MM choices and their effects. I have written on this topic before and my first personal rule is to keep my doctors on board and informed about anything outside the prescribed course of my treatment. Your doctor may not be thrilled over MM because like every natural medicine, science and fact are not mandatory like prescription drugs. <br> I haven&#8217,t had time to look this over but Leafly.com is a source of various MM strains with some description of content, treatments etc. Otherwise you are back in trial and error like sooo many medicines before. Hybrids are best to start with. Sativa or sativa dominant cannabis contains the highest levels of THC the main psychoactive drug. The rope industry developed Indica which has little THC but higher percentages of CBD&#8217,s. Hybrids are Sativa-Indica combinations like roses. You have more than most people can count.<br> <br> Delivery is very important. I recommend vaporizing. A decent vaporizer like Vapir NO2 is available for around $180. It is a digitally controlled heat chamber that once set about 360 degrees F. you are in business. If you want a whole lot more on the topic, pm me or if all the links here aren&#8217,t enough look back a couple of months when this was a topic.<br> <br> <br> LL ', 12928, '2013-10-05 23:45:26', 'KSJBLRTR')[0m

I LOVE what I do and I have a lot of flexibility with my schedule and I am able to work from home when needed. My education is in nursing and business, but I took a liking to computers when I started working, so I just fell in love with this career. As of right now, I am not finding it to be difficult to balance work and CF because I stay strict with my routine and make time for everything I need to do. I also find that being at work makes me feel better because I am around people and fulfilling my social needs, as well as contributing my skills to something important. <br> <br> Obviously, it takes time to develop a good relationship with your boss. But I have found that if you are a hard worker and prove yourself early on, that most bosses will work with you in return and allow some flexibility. I try to take days off for clinic appointments when I know I am not needed at work that day and when my work is caught up, I try not to inconvenience my coworkers or boss. However, I have also been hospitalized for a bowel obstruction unexpectedly, and that was not in my control. But because I kept my boss up to date with my status and my expected day of return, it all worked out just fine. But that is the best advice I can give - is be an over-the-top, hard worker and prove that you are there to do a good job and good things will come in return.<br> <br> As I said above, keeping a strict routine is key for me too. I am not post-transplant, so obviously my routine has nebs, CPT, etc. But Im sure your routine has to be more strict on things like eating regularly and taking your meds on time. So it may be wise to find a job that allows you to have the same scheduled hours so that you can stick more to a routine. I have found that when my hours varied (i.e. Monday was 7am-3pm, then Tuesday was 12-8pm), I was out of whack and I slacked on my CF stuff. Some people can deal with the awkward schedules, but I have found that it makes it easier for me because of all the maintenance required.<br> <br> Some other advice I have is not to disclose your CF right away to your boss. I often start off by asking for days off for appointments by just requesting a planned sick dayvacation day. Again, prove yourself. But also allow yourself the time you need to take care of your CF. If your boss mentions that you are excessively requesting time off, then that is a good time to explain in a sincere way that you are there to do a good job but that you have some health issues that need some attention from time to time. And just let the conversations roll from there. One job I had, I told my boss about my CF about 6 months in. Ironically her cousin who was very close to her also had CF, and this boss ended up being one of my best friends. We had such a good relationship inside and outside of our job because of my honesty and hard work.<br> <br> Life is too short to do something that doesnt make you happy. You need to enjoy going to work and using the skills that you have. Pick something that makes you smile, isnt too stressful, and makes you feel good at the end of the day. There are so many good things that can come out of going back to work, so good luck! ', 4637, '2013-10-05 23:45:26', 'JOQUXWIT')

Honestly, the only time you have to leave is to show buyers potential property, (if you choose) an open house on Sundays, or a run to the office...obviously every now and then you may need to meet an inspector or worker at a house. However, it has offered me a lot of freedom to do my treatments and rest if I am not feeling well. Also, you are not around a lot of people...that is one of the best parts. You can stay away from the sick during flu season and such. Yes, you will be around your clients but you do not meet with them everyday like in other jobs. If your clients are sick most all business can be taken care of over an email or phone call. It has been the perfect solution for me. Yes, the downside is that it is commission only and in the beginning you will be spending a lot of time in the office and learning from the managers.

" Hoi Vera, <br> <br> Those numbers arent set in stone here. It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in. But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. "

" Hoi Vera, <br> <br> Those numbers arent set in stone here. It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in. But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "

" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations.

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "

" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "

" Ive wondered that, too, Pat. Ill be 53 next month &amp, never had one. My fev1 is around 30% right now. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "

" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations.

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

" All changes regarding CF are described in section 3.04, which I am copying and pasting below. Or you can read it at: <a href=\\http:www.regulations.gov#!documentDetail"

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "
12130
" Ive wondered that, too, Pat. Ill be 53 next month &amp, never had one. My fev1 is around 30% right now. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" Im not 55, but can I play anyway? I turned 49 last May. God willing, Ill hit the big 5-0 next year. I was DX at birth, at Ft. Sam Houston, TX. I thank God my Dad was a Warrant Officer pilot. I think if he had not been in the Army when I was born, I wouldnt be alive today. I had the best medical care Uncle Sam could provide. Although Ive been all over the country, I live in Arizona &amp, have for almost all my life. Subtract the 7 years we were itinerant Army trash. I had to have a double-lung transplant at age 41. Mine, unfortunately, did not go as planned. Ive had what seems to be unceasing complications since then. The latest is I was facing a liver TX yesterday. Thank God my TX Doc called today &amp, told me the problem can be controlled with a new med. Anyway, thats my story &amp, Im sticking to it. Thanks for reading my rambling statement... Pat. "

" I am a certified 65.9 year old CF geezer. I about gave it up at 9 weeks with double pneumonia. My Mom was a trooper and got me out of it somehow (1947). My brother and sister both also had CF. I just had the gene test and doc didnt tell me what combo, just that I didnt qualify for the new genetically targeted med. My FEV 1 is now about 40 but I still exercise. I have a nice recumbent trike and I walk with my sweetest wife of 44 years.<br> <br> I just restarted digestive enzymes after a 25 year pause. Not for weight issues but for increasing gas....puuff....ahem....now I can add cancer (high PSA) high blood pressure, and a bad low hernia (probably from years of coughing my brains into mush, did I mention short term memory) and other minor old folks health issues to my list of lifes challenges...Lol "

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe.

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" Im not 55, but can I play anyway? I turned 49 last May. God willing, Ill hit the big 5-0 next year. I was DX at birth, at Ft. Sam Houston, TX. I thank God my Dad was a Warrant Officer pilot. I think if he had not been in the Army when I was born, I wouldnt be alive today. I had the best medical care Uncle Sam could provide. Although Ive been all over the country, I live in Arizona &amp, have for almost all my life. Subtract the 7 years we were itinerant Army trash. I had to have a double-lung transplant at age 41. Mine, unfortunately, did not go as planned. Ive had what seems to be unceasing complications since then. The latest is I was facing a liver TX yesterday. Thank God my TX Doc called today &amp, told me the problem can be controlled with a new med. Anyway, thats my story &amp, Im sticking to it. Thanks for reading my rambling statement... Pat. "

" I am a certified 65.9 year old CF geezer. I about gave it up at 9 weeks with double pneumonia. My Mom was a trooper and got me out of it somehow (1947). My brother and sister both also had CF. I just had the gene test and doc didnt tell me what combo, just that I didnt qualify for the new genetically targeted med. My FEV 1 is now about 40 but I still exercise. I have a nice recumbent trike and I walk with my sweetest wife of 44 years.<br> <br> I just restarted digestive enzymes after a 25 year pause.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe.

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" Yep I need a lot of sleep. 8-10 hours minimum on normal days and it quickly increases with significant activity or decreased health.

" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball.

I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" I never had that. Ask your doctor if you can culture it next time you see it. You can get a specimen container similar to a sputum cup.<br> <br> When I first read your post, I thought it was ovulation. If this happens only once per month then I say it is ovulation. If it is more often sounds like a CF thing.<br> <br> "

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "
2483
" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

Every morning this week Ive noticed DSs breath smells different -- like he has a sinus infection. But his nose is clear, no cough, just had cultures run and nothing growing....

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "
4159
" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "
6815
" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "

" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!!

Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed.

" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants. I would be a wreck if it wasnt for Zoloft. "

Sometimes they just come over to my house and we have pizza movie days, or lay out in the sun. Also my family is a big part of what keeps me feeling pretty good. "

" How did it look like if you dont mind me asking? I coughed up something weird a while back and still not sure what it was. It was hard, dark brown, and large as a pebble and foul tasting. "
9249
" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "

" If it continues, have it tested. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "

" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

" I am in Canada and have 24% lung function and have been on the list just over a year.<br> <br> Dave, "

" Thanks Dave. And you could get lungs anytime since youve been on the list right? Here they have 2 lists: the normal list and the high urgency list. Only people in the high urgency list can get lungs and those have to be really sick and close to dying. "
1032
" Hoi Vera, <br> <br> Those numbers arent set in stone here. It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in. But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. "

" Hi twistofchaos. I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. "
1032
" Hiya, <br> <br> Its relevant if you want to figure out how many transplants are actually done on people with CF. <br> I agree ofcourse that the whole transplant system has to be hugely improved, and mainly that donorship has to be the default for everyone till one objects and some specific exceptions. Which would solve a lot and its something that is proposed every few years here in politics but never quite makes it. <br> <br> Anyway in the US 1 per 3700 people are born with CF. <br> In the Netherlands thats 1 per 4750. <br> <br> So help me figure out how more people with CF get transplanted when you dont have a huge increase in transplants especially compared to the higher % of people with CF in the population. <br> Fewer people get screenedgo on the transplantlists in the US at all? "
7536
" I maintain that out of everyone waiting for a transplant in the US and in the NL, in the US they have a higher chance of receiving one. Not only do the numbers speak for themselves (I stated those in a previous reply), but just the fact that people in the US are able to receive lungs for a period of over 1 year or 2 and still be alive (a lot of them) at the end of that period shows that the chances there are higher. Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me. Due do shortage, you only get on the high urgency list (when you are finally able to receive lungs if they become available) when you are extremely sick and close to death. <br> I was also informed that due to my height (53&quot,), it will be even harder for me to get lungs that are suitable in the Netherlands because everyone is much taller than me. This presents another problem. "
1032
" Ok, <br> <br> About 4 million people are born in America a year. (some would call them babies)<br> In the Netherlands about 190.000 people are born a year. (some would call them gorgeous studs) <br> <br> Ignoring immigration, because who knows whats going on there and atleast both countries have plenty of that so. <br> <br> 4 million  1 per 3700 people = 1081 people are born with CF a year in the US. <br> 190.000  1 per 4750 people = 40 people are born with CF a year in the Netherlands. <br> <br> 1600 transplants a year with 1081 people born with CF a year = 1.48 times as many transplants. <br> 60 transplants a year with 40 people born with CF a year = 1.5 times as many transplants.<br> <br> Sure everything is much better in the US but their transplantrate seems fairly identical. <br> <br> You say here the waitinglist is more than twice as big as the transplantrate but in America its almost one on one. Then what gives? Thats not cynical, Im curious. <br> They were doing transplants in the US earlier (1969) but weve been doing them for a while here as well (1990, and since 2001 in 3 locations) so Im not sure how in 2013 we still have a 200+% demand here but not in the US. <br> <br> Anyway but my parents always saved a lot and me and my sister were indeed raised from early age with the idea to save money if one day we had to go to the US (or another country) if we would need a transplant. To be able pay for it ourselves. Still always live with that idea when it comes to spending money and so CF turned me into a terrible cheapskate. That by the way counts his savings at night in the dark with nothing but a flickering candleflame softly laughing with always suddenly a thunderstorm over my house out of nowhere when I do that. Weird. "
7536
" Youre still focusing on the total number of people with cf and newborns etc, and not on the number of people on a transplant list at any given time. It doesnt matter if 1000 people are born with cf or not, what matters is how many of those will be on the transplant list at the same time (as far as what my question is, Im sure your numbers count towards different studies). "
1032
" Yes because how many people you put on a transplantlist is quite arbitrary and I rather wish to know how many transplants are actually done. but never mind that. "

" IN THE NEWS: Sarah Murnaghan, a ten-year old with cystic fibrosis, needs a lung transplant. She has weeks to live. Federal policy requires a child must be at least twelve years old to be on the adult transplant list. Sarah wont live to twelve without the transplant.Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Kathleen Sebelius, has asked for a review of the policy but has said it will takes years to make any changes. The HHS Chief of Staffs telephone number is 202690-8157. I called to voice my opinion and they transferred me to a hot-line for the Office of the Secretary where I was permitted to leave a message. I dont know that it will help Sarah, but it was worth a try. I encourage you to call and voice your opinion. "

5003
" This has nothing to do with &quot,Obamacare&quot, - this has everything to do with the organ allocation system. Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

" Obviously this girls doctors thought she was an acceptable candidate for adult lungs its just her age that caused the issue and a technicality like that shouldnt decide if a person lives or dies. Its just an example that one size rules do not fit all. And whats even more concerning is the CFFs lack of advocacy I mean even if they were against this girl getting a transplant Id like to hear them say it. They are our biggest advocate and yet they stayed silent. Even in the response they put out they say they want to leave the decision between the doctor and patient. Well, the doctor and patient thought this girl should have a transplant and this one rule stopped them. "
5003
" I know this is a very sensitive issue but has anyone considered that the &quot,age&quot, rule was developed in 2005. I dont think it should be about age as much as body size and mass. Lung transplantation is very tricky, much more difficult than a kidney or liver. A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off. Is this case just about age or about the disgraceful lack of organ donors in general? "

" Three of the past four days, Ive woken up with a sharp pain under the lower part of my right rib cage, more toward my back than front. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and knows what it is. Its not my usual lung-related pain, because its not worse when I inhale, and my mucus is about the same. I did have a low fever and aches one of the days, but am not sure if thats relevant. <br> <br> So, in the morning, I wake up and the pain is maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but once Im up-up, its like a 0-3. And by three or four pm, its completely gone--UNLESS (heres the weird thing) I swallow a big bite of food. A few seconds after swallowing, I get a flash of pain in the area.<br> <br> Im not nauseous or having out of the ordinary GI symptoms. Im exercising like normal too--went rock climbing one of the days and did zumba another. Lying down and pushing my back into the floor makes it hurt more. So I was thinking a muscle thing, but the food-swallow thing is odd.<br> <br> Any ideas? "

" My first thought was gallstones as well, but it is possible that it could be pleurisy.<br> <br> I had my gallbladder removed about 8 years ago. I didnt have stabbing back pain or anything - BUT back pain on the right side below the shoulder is common with gallstones and gallbladder issues. I would get symptoms similar to anxiety attacks, tightness in my chest and pain when I would try to breathe. I would also get nausea and vomiting as time passed. For my I had attacks and symptoms directly related to drinking soda or any carbonated beverage. That being said a lot of people get symptoms when they eat, but symptoms and attacks are often associated with eating fatty foods or greasy foods. <br> <br> I hope it is nothing and that it goes away, but I would definitely bring it up to your doc and ask if they can check it out if it continues. As for pleurisy it is usually a result of infection but just because you arent coughing more or dont have excess mucus doesnt mean anything. If you have an infection and any area of the lung tissue is inflamed it can result in pleurisy.<br> <br> Hope you start feeling better soon. "

He moved out and is living with his girlfriend. He dropped out of college. It just seems like he is giving up. <br> At his visit with his doctor today he was told that his numbers are so bad that he is a candidate for the transplant list - but that because he doesnt do his treatments, they wouldnt give him the transplant. My sister-in-law is devastated, but is at a total loss about what to do. <br> <br> <br> We are all so worried. The family is planning an intervention for this weekend. <br> <br> <br> So, my question: Does anyone have any advice? Or anything that you (as someone who has experience with CF (in any capacity)) think that he should know? Or anything at all???? I would greatly appreciate any guidance. <br> <br> <br> Thank you so much! "

" Hi, Sarah0312.<br> <br> I am so sorry that you and your family are having to go through this. It must be extremely difficult to watch your nephew decline and not be able to do anything about it. I am glad that you found your way to this community. There are many people here who have gone through rebellious stages in the course of their lives. Many stopped doing treatments and taking care of their bodies for a time. I am hoping they will post in the next few days and share their stories with you and how they felt throughout that time.<br> <br> My words of advice are to remember that he is probably angry and upset with his situation. Remind him that you all still love him and care about him and want him to choose to live. Without doing his treatments he is basically committing suicide. Make sure he understands what his actions are doing to the family and that they hurt you because you love him. If he wont do it for himself, maybe he will do it for the people who love him.<br> <br> Best of luck to you and your family. I will keep you all in my prayers! "

" So sorry to hear about this. Have you thought of talking to his girlfriend? Maybe if your nephews parents know her well enough to have a serious conversation. My guess is she doesnt realize how serious the situation is and if she did, she would probably encouragemake him do his treatments. Best of luck! "

" I hate CF, and no one knows the psychological issues that goes with the disease. And I am noticing a female with CF has a whole different outlook on life than a male with CF. What do us males have to look forward too ? I have been fired from jobs because, the health insurance company that carried the company was told as long as I was employed by them they was going to increase all the employees insurance rates. The insurance company told my employer that someday I may have to have a lung transplant. Well that was 15 years ago and my Pulminary functions still range in the lower to mid 80s. We can not have a family of our own, because 98% of males with CF are sterile. It took me over 4 years to get S.S.D.I. that is because the SSA does not have a clue about all the aspects of how crippling this disease is, that was after I lost my house I built for my High school sweet heart. The only reason I keep going is because I am going to prove to this disease that I can beat it, and it is not going to get me down.........Scorp "

" Sarah0312: Im so sorry to hear about your nephew and what he and your family are going through. I too watch my DS not do his treatments like he should. I also know the heartache it causes me. The CFF has a section about anxiety and depression. They note that teenagers and young adults are most at risk for having symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with younger children (under the age of 12) or adults over the age of 30. It also says that people who are depressed or anxious may have trouble focusing and remembering to do their treatments or may feel hopeless and think that doing their treatments will not help and they may stop doing them. Perhaps if your nephews family could convince him to be seen and put on an antidepressant this would help him to want to take care of himself. I wish the best for your nephew. I will have him in my prayers. "
10188
" Damn, I know what hes going through all too well. I was diagnosed at 15 and I became a real rebel monster. I was on a mission and that was to destroy myself. It was very difficult to reason with me, but I did continue to do my treatments, because I never minded that, it was a few minutes every day that I could just sit and nebulize stuff while using the computer. <br> Anyway, back to your problem - I think that his depression is blocking him from being able to fully understand what the reality of his condition is. This is a strong state of denial and thats why you get the feeling that he thinks he is invincible. Its not that he thinks that, its just that he thinks he has nothing to lose and nothing to live for. <br> The only thing at the time that kept pulling me back to reality was my family and the unconditional love they always offered me. Still to this day thats what keeps me going. <br> I think if he agrees to see a therapist and take anti-depressants that could really help him, but he has to be willing to. I think the intervention could maybe help if you guys show a lot of love, and maybe even some tears. It would work with me, and it did. <br> <br> Best of luck. "
1032
" I expect today&#8217,s CF post is about to hit so I&#8217,ll make this short. Short for me at least. Unless your nephew has made statements to the effect that he feels invincible, this might be a memory of your youth. More than likely your mother told you that you seemed to act as though you were invincible rather than a memory of personal insight from that age.<br> <br> Right now I am trying to wrap my mind around the idea of being 19, sitting in my doc&#8217,s office being told my life may be over soon. I pray that isn&#8217,t the case but this news is harsh, deep down lays an unnatural dread. You don&#8217,t have to be a rocket scientist to realize there is a complex series of events that must coalesce for this to work. Not to mention we haven&#8217,t started growing corrected clones of our lungs so until then it is a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs. He might be feeling a little too mortal. As hard as it is to contemplate a life too short, it is only too short to the older observer. Death is just as real at five as fifty five when you&#8217,re dying.<br> <br> I am the last person to advise how to live within my limits. I have been testing fate and defying death my whole life and it has served me well. I had a similar situation with my mother some years back. Shortly after I was born she was laid low for an entire year with rheumatic fever. This damaged her heart which along with cigarette smoking met with a severe heart attack when she was 49. For a smoker with a heart condition she was remarkably fit. She was trim, active and happy but she was dying from congestive heart disease from the first heart attack on.<br> <br> After the heart attack, rehab and quitting smoking, she was healthier than ever. But, she was from a smoking generation, married to a smoker and too soon she was smoking again. During a visit at our non smoking house, she being the exception, I asked her why she started smoking again. It was the pressure and the absolute denial over it killing her. And she said as much. I directly asked her to try to stop again for good. She rather fatalistically asked me why it should matter. Blubber, blubber, I melted and told her I would like to have a mother around as long as possible. She stopped. Maybe it is good to just tell him how much he means to you and use that currency.<br> <br> LL "

" I thought JMVs advice about talking to the gf could be helpful. But something to consider is his possible anxiety about how the gf will take the news. He may be worried that she will break up with him if she finds out and that may be why he is refusing to take his meds? "
15049
" No talking to the GF or anyone else is a horrible idea. Not only is it subverting his newly found independence, but its undermining the real reasons he needs to change. If he will not change for himself there is no better reason for him do do so. Sure, you can try to guilt trip him into changing for the benefit of family, and it might work, or it might fail miserably. I would hazard a guess that hes already taken some lectures at home and thats probably why hes at the GFs place, therefore any more manipulation will further estrange him from his family.<br> <br> My advice? Tell him you love him no matter what and see if you can get him to come back home. Dont threaten, guilt trip, pressure or coerce him into any treatments while at home. Hes going to have to learn, perhaps the hard way, how important sticking to treatments are. Theres probably nothing that can be done about that.<br> <br> Good luck "

" Hi everyone. I just got out of the hospital a couple days ago but while I was in, a few days after I had been admitted, I coughed up blood. And it wasnt just a little, they said it was probably about 200cc which i believe is almost a cup of just blood, no sputum. I was put into the icu for the night just in case it happened again (it didnt). I was curious to know how many others this had happened to because the on-call pulmonary doc made sound as if it was fairly common among cf patients with lungs as bad as mine. My pfts have been hovering in between %26 and %29 for the past couple months and ive coughed up blood before. But this was the first time I have ever coughed up that much so it really freaked me out. "
15029
" Im so sorry your dealing with this. Several years ago the same thing happened to me. It can be very scary. Are you on pulmozyme? I ended up being taken off of it indefinitely because I was having so much hemoptysis. "
14987
" Ive been on pulmozyme as long as I can remember. They did have me on the 7% hypertonic saline when i first went in, at home I only do 3%. But after I had my little episode they stopped both for a couple days. <br> Has it continued to happen to you even though youve stopped the pulmozyme? What really worried me about the whole thing is that I was not even doing anything to bring it on. I was sitting in my bed about to go to sleep and it had been at least 2 hours since my last treatment. "

" I can really relate to that &#8220,freaked out&#8221, sensation. Especially your accurately described &#8220,nearly a cup&#8221, of blood!!! Even when we understand and are prepared for something like coughing up a lot of blood, it is little consolation when it happens to you. I didn&#8217,t even know what an hemoptysis was until I had my palm full of one. <br> <br> For me, knowing and understanding helps limit anxiety. At first, with no understanding of where and why this was happening, I was dutifully scooping each clot into old script bottles, logging the time and what I felt etc. until I could be seen by my pulmonologist. The reason behind my hemoptysis was simple pleural effusion, painful but hardly what you went through. In total I had less than 50cc of blood clots and very little unclotted blood. <br> <br> As far as taking clotting agents like the prescription Lysteda, brand name for tranexamic acid, this may be helpful at some point. Kyeev has a lot of knowledge and experience behind his medical management, and routinely does what he does within a margin of safety and risk. Unless you are a hematologist, any venture into taking clotting agents to limit hemoptysis needs to be a cautious path with the full participation of your medical team.<br> <br> It can be savior or assassin, just be careful.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ive had problems with hemoptysis before intermittently and have a couple episodes where I coughed up maybe half the amount of blood you had. I found that Pulmozyme always makes me cough up blood, so I dont take it. I do use 5% hypertonic saline although they reduced me to once a day because of blood. <br> <br> They put me on vitamin K, which has helped me quite a bit. The pill form is extremely expensive in North America, but you can get it in liquid form for cheaper. <br> <br> I hope you dont have ongoing problems with this. "

" I hate to say it, but Im relieved this has happened to other people. It makes me feel better to hear its not totally uncommon. <br> <br> As for fixing it, when I was in the icu they said if it continued to happen they would do the whole embolizing thing. And I was put on 15mg of vitamin K the reminder of the time I was there. But since it has not happened again and my sputum hasnt even had any blood streaks or anything Im hoping it was a one time occurrence because of a bad infection and an amount of saline I just could not tolerate. <br> <br> Thank you all for your insight, I will definitely be prepared if it happens again and hopefully wont panic as much.

" Recently, my niece copied a picture from my Facebook page and put it up on her own page asking people to pray for my child and announcing that he had CF. I very kindly asked her to please take it down as she has 800 friends and some day my little boy will be a teenager and may not want CF announced. She did take it down, but apparently her feelings were very hurt. I was actually the one questioned by my family. I felt like I was the one being attacked. I was made to feel like I was ashamed of my child for having CF and what was wrong with me. I was told that CF wasnt something you could hide. My husband and I have an agreement, dont hide it, be open about it, but dont announce it on public forums like Facebook. I think we have a pretty healthy approach to it. I want by child to be open about CF but I know that one day he will be a teenager and I dont want to take away all of his choices. He may choose to first let people get to know him, and then tell him has CF later or whatever he chooses. I know how difficult it is to be a teenager. The thing is, we live in such a small town, I know everyone will know, and we have to teach him just to say, &quot,Yeah, I have CF, but its okay.&quot, But I also dont think we should announce it publicly. What are your opinions about this? It has just caused all kinds of bad feelings, and we sure dont need any negative vibes right now. rosesixtyfive, mother of 3 year old boy, ddf508 "

" wow that was inappropriate of her! When I told my sister she jumped on the phone and called all her kids and told them. I felt that was my place to do that. FB is worse though. You are a right. It is your sont choice - not other peoples. "
12077
" Ive been dealing with CF for almost 28 years now and I would have to say that somebody posting on Facebook about your child having CF should be the least of your worries. And I would have to agree with your family about this. You should want people to know about your sons CF so they may pray for him! Having CF is most certainly something that you cant hide and by asking her to take it off Facebook is acting like you are ashamed that your son has CF as people have said to you already. It could also send the wrong message to your son when he is old enough to understand his situation. I know you think you are protecting him by this behavior but in the future this behavior will only hinder him. If you act like CF should be hidden it gives him the message that he has a weakness that should be hidden from the world and that WILL make him weak. He may start withdrawing from social events because he feels like he should be ashamed of his CF instead of embracing it and taking charge of it. You want him to be able to say to people who question it, &quot,Yeah, I have CF...sooo?&quot, Now Im not saying you should tell every single person you come in contact with but the more prayers he has the better off he is! The thing that baffles me about normal people is that they act like just because we have a disease we are some kind of deformed creature that needs to wear a &quot,normal&quot, mask to hide the ugliness within us. You need to teach your son that he is NORMAL and that having to do breathing treatments and take lots of meds just helps him to live a normal life. As a child growing up with CF I was never allowed to use CF as an excuse. I was expected to be like every other kid out there and I was expected to get good grades and do my chores, etc. My parents wouldnt even allow me to file with Students with Disabilities in college because that would allow me to be weak if and when I chose to be. Teach your son that CF is not a disability, CF is just a challenge that you have to overcome. As a kid I always thought that my parents were hard on me but now I am soooo thankful they were like that because they have taught me to be tough. CF is not my defining characteristic...I am a geologist by education, a Seismic Data Specialist by occupation, a wife, a homeowner, and a mother to two furry kids...but I just happen to have CF. That is what you want for your son! Thats what you need to focus on... not what somebody posted on Facebook. Nobody should be ashamed of CF, CF is not some poor life decision we made that we have to live with now, its just the cards we were dealt. The &quot,cards&quot, of CF is not what defines us...what does define us is how we choose to play the game of life, fold or go all in!! Good luck with your son and please dont ever let CF define who he is! Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of CF, and PLEASE dont let your son be either! Having this mentality now will only make him feel uncomfortable in social or public situations down the road. "

" Im a fellow parent and I do not want people putting my kids on their Facebook pages for ANY reason. Social media is not benign and this is an important boundary issue, not a crime and not an issue of shame, but one of privacy and boundaries. Were all negotiating a new world where nothing is truly deletable and a digital identity should be in the control of the parents and then gradually released to the child as heshe gains maturity. Your nieces intention was lovely but this is a teachable moment for her about social media and privacy. "
6072
" I agree with rosesixtyfive, your niece should of asked you about mentioning that your son has CF. I feel like she ment no harm but privacy is very important to certain people and your son may be one. I went through that stage (privacy) my self when I was a you boy early teenage yrs., not that i was ashamend that I had CF but did not like someone else giving out info about me. This was a aunt that I loved very much. She and I had a talk and she agreed with me. Has nothing to do about trying to hide CF or be ashamed of so let the imedate family, mom and dad as well as the CF person when they get old enogh give out personal info. Discriminaton does exists even we say it can not, so some future employer could see this and may not hire him because of his health. One should think long and hard before giving out personl information especially about somone else with the social media we have today!! "
2569
" The whole point of Facebook is to share our lives with the world, correct? If you dont want people posting anything on their FB pages from your FB page, then dont have a FB page at all. Honestly, I wish more people would censor what they put on FB. But I have to ask...whats the difference between Facebook and this PUBLIC CF forum? Nothing that I know of, all it takes is an email address and BOOM, youre on a social media website, much like this one... Even though this website is designed for a special cause it is still a SOCIAL MEDIA website and as Melissa75 stated...nothing is truly deletable. "

" Were very open about my kids CF in our community (shes just entering Kindergarten) since we do things like go on preschool camping trips with everyone and bring her nebs and vest and everything along and do treatments at the campsite. But I wouldnt like it to be something someone could find easily by doing a Google or Facebook search on my daughters name, since someday she may wish to apply for a job and not have the fact of her diagnosis be the one of the first things people see when they look her up online prior to meeting her for an interview. We dont do Facebook though so that helps. It is an interesting question as a parent, when your story (as a parent of a person with cystic fibrosis) stops being yours to tell to the world so much because of the desire to let your child frame their own story, complete with respect for their medical privacy. "
8228
" Wow! My family will be like Sarah. My son is in preschool and takes his enzymes. He knows to respond openly if kids ask him. So, no, it is not a secret. I want everyone in the world to know how much he struggles...but not on Facebook. And Aggie, there is a huge difference in being on this page where people are anonymous and people can come for support. She took a picture from my Facebook page and tacked on some medical information. Fine to take the picture, which was already there, but not the medical information. We pray for my son, but with close personal friends, and believe me God hears that without it being announced on a social media webpages. Its funny, just last year when I wanted to send a letter home in preschool explaining what CF was, I was criticized by CF adults who asked me why I would do that to my child? That is what made me reevaluate how I would approach it. Openness, not hiding anything, and pride in our struggles - perfect...but announcing on Facebook and other public forums - something we just wouldnt do. My little boy knows how proud I am, and he knows I am so proud of him for fighting CF....dont worry, Aggie, there is no shame involved here and he is being raised to be proud of everything he is and has to go through. "

" <span style=\\font-family: arial black\\\"><font size=\\\"3\\\">I think your child has the right to absolute privacy in this matter. I couldnt tell anyone for years that I had CF because the job I did demanded a physical. I would have been physically disqualified if the whole world knew of my condition. You are absolutely right in this. Whoever posted that on FB should have asked your permission first. That is incredibly thoughtless for them to do that. <font><span> \""

" How does one go about getting rx or supply of correct product. I live in NJ where licensed cannabis dispensaries have recently opened. Only little and vague info has seeped out to the general public on how to go about obtaining the correct approach to using cannabis as a resource. Does a doctor prescribe it or do you have to &quot,wing-it&quot,? "
15027
" If New Jersey is similar to Colorado&#8217,s Medical Marijuana Registry (MMR) this is how you go about getting Medical Marijuana (MM). The MMR collects applications and fees for people wanting to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, processes the applications and in return the send MMR cards or &#8220,Red Cards&#8221, to the patients. With this MMR card you can go to any MM dispensary in your state and purchase medical cannabis and MM products such as edibles or tinctures.<br> <br> To obtain a MMR card you need to visit a dispensary or three in your area. They should have several advertisements for medical doctors specializing in MM evaluations. The main reason your pediatrician or adult CF specialist doesn&#8217,t perform MM evaluations as well as treat your other CF issues has to do with looming Federal laws that could befall any doctor. A MM evaluation in most cases involves a cursory physical exam, a MM evaluation* and all the paperwork to obtain your MMR or whatever they call it in NJ. In summary, see a doctor that does MMR or MM evaluations, send in the paperwork from the doctor that includes your evaluation, application, copy of current ID etc. along with the State fee and wait for the mail.<br> <br> *MMR evaluation for anybody with documented medical issues is very straight forward. We are why this law happened so don&#8217,t worry about big brother here. A copy of a recent CF clinic evaluation that usually notes the particulars like &#8220,CF, DLT, CFRD etc., along with a sweat test or genetic test and a blood test or such is more than plenty. The actual medical marijuana evaluation won&#8217,t involve more than a fifteen minute visit with the doctor. During that time plus some of the time waiting for the doctor will be spent with office staff double checking applications, getting ID&#8217,s copied and in general making certain if you can affix a stamp to an envelope, you&#8217,re in.<br> <br> I haven&#8217,t started going through rmotion&#8217,s links but my guess is you will find out far more than you need to know about MM choices and their effects. I have written on this topic before and my first personal rule is to keep my doctors on board and informed about anything outside the prescribed course of my treatment. Your doctor may not be thrilled over MM because like every natural medicine, science and fact are not mandatory like prescription drugs. <br> I haven&#8217,t had time to look this over but Leafly.com is a source of various MM strains with some description of content, treatments etc. Otherwise you are back in trial and error like sooo many medicines before. Hybrids are best to start with. Sativa or sativa dominant cannabis contains the highest levels of THC the main psychoactive drug. The rope industry developed Indica which has little THC but higher percentages of CBD&#8217,s. Hybrids are Sativa-Indica combinations like roses. You have more than most people can count.<br> <br> Delivery is very important. I recommend vaporizing. A decent vaporizer like Vapir NO2 is available for around $180. It is a digitally controlled heat chamber that once set about 360 degrees F. you are in business. If you want a whole lot more on the topic, pm me or if all the links here aren&#8217,t enough look back a couple of months when this was a topic.<br> <br> <br> LL "

My &quot,on&quot, months feel much more productive and generally better.<br> <br> Yeah, its 3x a day, but it literally takes 3 minutes tops and the compressor is SUPER portable. "

" I am just curious what everyone here does for work and if they find what they do enjoyable? Do you find balancing work and having CF difficult? I havent been back to work since my transplant 2 12 years ago and Im about to start looking for work again. Any tips or tricks on finding appropriate work for a CFer? Any guidance would help. "

" Hi there,<br> <br> I do computer applications in the healthcare environment. I LOVE what I do and I have a lot of flexibility with my schedule and I am able to work from home when needed. My education is in nursing and business, but I took a liking to computers when I started working, so I just fell in love with this career. As of right now, I am not finding it to be difficult to balance work and CF because I stay strict with my routine and make time for everything I need to do. I also find that being at work makes me feel better because I am around people and fulfilling my social needs, as well as contributing my skills to something important. <br> <br> Obviously, it takes time to develop a good relationship with your boss. But I have found that if you are a hard worker and prove yourself early on, that most bosses will work with you in return and allow some flexibility. I try to take days off for clinic appointments when I know I am not needed at work that day and when my work is caught up, I try not to inconvenience my coworkers or boss. However, I have also been hospitalized for a bowel obstruction unexpectedly, and that was not in my control. But because I kept my boss up to date with my status and my expected day of return, it all worked out just fine. But that is the best advice I can give - is be an over-the-top, hard worker and prove that you are there to do a good job and good things will come in return.<br> <br> As I said above, keeping a strict routine is key for me too. I am not post-transplant, so obviously my routine has nebs, CPT, etc. But Im sure your routine has to be more strict on things like eating regularly and taking your meds on time. So it may be wise to find a job that allows you to have the same scheduled hours so that you can stick more to a routine. I have found that when my hours varied (i.e. Monday was 7am-3pm, then Tuesday was 12-8pm), I was out of whack and I slacked on my CF stuff. Some people can deal with the awkward schedules, but I have found that it makes it easier for me because of all the maintenance required.<br> <br> Some other advice I have is not to disclose your CF right away to your boss. I often start off by asking for days off for appointments by just requesting a planned sick dayvacation day. Again, prove yourself. But also allow yourself the time you need to take care of your CF. If your boss mentions that you are excessively requesting time off, then that is a good time to explain in a sincere way that you are there to do a good job but that you have some health issues that need some attention from time to time. And just let the conversations roll from there. One job I had, I told my boss about my CF about 6 months in. Ironically her cousin who was very close to her also had CF, and this boss ended up being one of my best friends. We had such a good relationship inside and outside of our job because of my honesty and hard work.<br> <br> Life is too short to do something that doesnt make you happy. You need to enjoy going to work and using the skills that you have. Pick something that makes you smile, isnt too stressful, and makes you feel good at the end of the day. There are so many good things that can come out of going back to work, so good luck! "

" Hello, I work at a winery in southern California. I work at the hotel in the lounge as a cocktail server. I like being a server because Im moving at a fast pace for about 6 hours. At my place we have to go up an down stairs to get to the kitchen, so I at least walk up 15 flights of stairs a night. I am in school to become an ultrasound tec, if I get into the school. The percentage of me getting in is low but Im hoping they will pick me because being an ultrasound tec is something I can do with CF. "

" I am a real estate agent. The schooling only takes a month. I get to choose my hours and 85% of the work is done over the phone, email, or paper work that is faxed...which means I get to stay at home a lot. Right now I am on IVs and I stayed in my PJs all day. The only work I had today was all taken care of by phone and emails. Honestly, the only time you have to leave is to show buyers potential property, (if you choose) an open house on Sundays, or a run to the office...obviously every now and then you may need to meet an inspector or worker at a house. However, it has offered me a lot of freedom to do my treatments and rest if I am not feeling well. Also, you are not around a lot of people...that is one of the best parts. You can stay away from the sick during flu season and such. Yes, you will be around your clients but you do not meet with them everyday like in other jobs. If your clients are sick most all business can be taken care of over an email or phone call. It has been the perfect solution for me. Yes, the downside is that it is commission only and in the beginning you will be spending a lot of time in the office and learning from the managers. Once you build up a clientele and really understand the contracts most work can be done from home. "

" I work full-time as a coordinator at the College of Medicine. I love my job and working with the medical students. As someone mentioned earlier it is important to work hard and prove yourself. If your work and attendance record is exceptional, employers are more likely to be flexible when need be. I havent been on IV meds for a couple years now, but I am fortunate that I have my own office and can shut the door and do IVs while working. I have also made workouts part of my daily schedule and this has helped me stay healthy and miss less work. Sometimes I think it would be great to be at home but I working keeps me healthy (mentally and physically) plus we need the income. "

" I am a geologist by education but I work as a Seismic Data Specialist and its great. I work 980s which yield a long day (Im up at 5am, at work by 6:20am, leave at 4:20pm and home by 5:10ish) but I have every other Friday off which is really nice to catch up on sleep or go to doctor appointments without having to miss work. I would have to say that because I have to leave so early in the morning I do not have time to take my treatments. I usually do my albuterol inhaler to help open up my lungs for the day but I dont do anything else. I do make sure I take a really good treatment when I get home with at least 45 minutes of Vest time though. Luckily, I have stayed pretty healthy...only 2 IV therapy sessions in the past 5 years with my FEV1 at 73%. I wouldnt recommend this type of schedule for someone thats had a transplant or has to do a lot of IV sessions but it has worked for me the past couple years so I am going to rock it out now while I am making awesome money and save up for the time in the future when I wont be able to work this schedule anymore. It is a tough schedule to keep and balancing work with CF and other normal life activities is tiring at times but I just keep pushing forward. I didnt go this far with my life to give up now...if I was to quit, everything I did to get here would be a waste of time and money. Plus, I have too many people to prove wrong to give up...thats probably my true motivation. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe. I guess I learned how to take care of my problems even though I didnt know anything about CF. "

" I was diagnosed at 43 after 6 episodes of pancreatitis within a 6 month period. Finally had genetic testing and positive sweat test. Always have had sinus issues, thought it was allergies my whole life! I saw a specialist in Boston and found out that a lot of people get diagnosed as adults. Never knew. "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "
4159
" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "
15443
" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Look up inclined bed therapy. You can put your headboard on risers so that the whole bed is inclined, yet your back will be helped because you are sort of still lying flat. My husband and I are currently trying this because he snores and this supposedly helps. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed.

" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "

" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" I have been a stay at home Mom &amp, Domestic Goddess for the last 5 years. Previous to that I had worked at our local hospital in the admissions &amp, billing departments. In addition to assuring accurate info about the patients, I verified insurance &amp, contacted companies for approval &amp, started paperwork for those without insurance for them to get assistance. I was there for 12 years. Previous to that I was the Senior Dispatcher at an Answering Service which was assisting our new 911 Center with the transfer of responses to calls for local fire, ambulance &amp, police calls. I was there for 1 12 years. I would have stayed, but when I finally became eligible for insurance (which took a year of employment), I was told for my CF to be covered I would have another year waiting period. I knew I couldnt risk it so I left. My job before that which was my first job ever &amp, my first job out of high school was Assistant Legal Secretary at a local law firm. The criminal attorney is who I worked for &amp, it was very interesting because of our large range of clientel. Everything from DWI to Ohio Mafia. I thank my High School PrincipalScience teacher for giving me a good recommendation on that. The girl who hired me for the law firm was my Principals neighbor. I left there because the Senior lawyer (who was 79) &amp, I clashed big time. I was still young &amp, didnt like to be bellowed to &amp, expect to be a servant like his secretary of many years was. He &amp, I had a meeting one day after a blow up &amp, he kept saying &quot, I dont want anyone to lose their job, I dont want anyone to have to lose their job.&quot, Obviously it wasnt him who would lose his job since he owned the firm, building etc. So I quit. The joys of being young with no responsibilities. I was there for 1 12 years. Thats my employment stories! "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants.

Im really not trying to get in the way of my family having a fun trip, but all I want to do at this point is sleep.

" your body tells you what it needs. Dont let others give you advice about your body - people, who do not have the slightest idea what CF means to your body. We are constantly fighting germs and bacteria, our lungs are working double if not triple duty - more than any &quot,normal&quot, body. That takes energy. You get energy when you recover and sleep. Just take a nap.<br> My in-laws never understand that I need to rest - they do not see anything physical wrong with me and taking a nap is a sign of weakness or sign of old age to them.<br> Screw them - its my health and my body!

I have a mild case of CF, and Im ALWAYS tired. Im otherwise healthy at the moment. Good weight, great health other than my lungs. I can sleep an hour or two any afternoon and turn around and go right back to sleep at night and sleep thru the night. I dont usually have time to nap, but I find myself constantly needing to. Is this common? Ive had thyroid checked and everything I can think of. Sometimes I feel like I have narcolepsy. "

" But you look fine? Enjoy the days when nobody sees how hard you work. If it were my parents, Id wait until about bedtime and piss them off with something that will keep them awake. Do this nightly until you have the advantage.<br> <br> Once they cant keep from destroying a room for a lost bill or such, its time to turn the tables. If a clear statement that you need 9 hours of sleep daily is beyond comprehension you need heavy guns to make your point. Skip meals to catch up sleep. Eat on the road with some take out orders, filled while the folks eat. If this takes too long, lower your expectations. Not really, but you are grouchy, a sign of fatigue. Maybe you should save energy holding your tongue.<br> <br> A medical answer, 8 to 9 hours sleep at a minimum for some average CFer.

" Yep I need a lot of sleep. 8-10 hours minimum on normal days and it quickly increases with significant activity or decreased health. Can go one or two nights with less but it quickly catches up with me. <br> Depending on where you are at with your health CF is tiring on the body, activity counts double and our bodies need the recoverytime. <br> <br> Trips are wonderful especially active ones but you do need the rest. Nothing much to do about that. If not you simply stop functioning after a few days or get actually sick. When traveling with a group they either have to keep you in consideration or you could skip a day and rest at the hotel. <br> <br> Went to Norway recently and on active trips like that I get up early-ish, 6 or 7 and then Im active through the day. (Walk, travel, see things) But then I have no choice but to head back to the hotel after dinnertime and try to be in bed with lights out at 9 or so in the evening. Who cares, had a great trip where all went well and all that I really missed out on were the drunk Norwegian women at night. .. ohh "

I was always falling asleep on the sofa at 8pm (which was annoying as I would never get to see the end of a movie!) However, since I have been supplementing my <a href=\\http:www.glutathione4cf.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">glutathione<a> levels"

" Has anyone coughed up tissue from their lungs before? This is a first for me and it is a little disturbing. "
5439
" You should be telling this to your CF Specialist!!!! "
9620
" I spoke with the RN who says it is probably sputum. However I am a nurse too and it doesnt look like it to me. They said just keep an eye on it to see if there are any changes. Maybe I am just worrying too much. "
5439
" How did it look like if you dont mind me asking? I coughed up something weird a while back and still not sure what it was. It was hard, dark brown, and large as a pebble and foul tasting. "
9249
" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "
5439
" If it continues, have it tested. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" I love music...not talented in it, but LOVE to listen to lyrics and the beat. When my doctor retired back maybe 15ish years ago (when CFers could still hang out) we had a big party for him. They played &quot,Hero&quot, by Mariah Carey. So that song has a very special memory for me.<br> <br> Also, &quot,My wish for you&quot, by Rascall Flatts. It was popular when my friend Kay got her tx (she later passed away). It always makes me think of her. "

" Big Shot by Billy Joel...ever since I was little. Its more my theme song about my triumph in life not expressive of a battle with cf. <br> <br> I remember the first time it really got in my head.

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" I never had that. Ask your doctor if you can culture it next time you see it. You can get a specimen container similar to a sputum cup.<br> <br> When I first read your post, I thought it was ovulation. If this happens only once per month then I say it is ovulation. If it is more often sounds like a CF thing.<br> <br> "

" Hey there:<br> <br> It really bugs me when docs say that some symptom is a CF thing. I have to say I have never experienced anything like that before. I could see things being thicker, but I would have what you have described checked out a bit more. Good Luck to ya! "

" I get that about my time of ovulation. &amp,nbsp,It is clear but I can<br> definitely tell it is mucus.

1942
" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "
2483
" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

Fun.<br> <br> One time in high school I was hanging out with some buddies and my J-tube just randomly feel out of my stomach. My friends werent too grossed out by that, but then I picked it up, washed it, and put it back in my stomach. My one buddy turned green.<br> <br> Not to long ago I had a huge coughing spell while driving on the highway and my mouth was full of mucus. I rolled down the window to spit but did not have enough wind in my lungs to get it all out. I painted the side of my car! Of course it was summer and by the time I got home it was all baked on my car. Took 2 weeks to finally get it all of after multiple car washes and scrubbing. "

" When I first got the g-tube, I had the one with the permanent extension that had to be clamped and taped to the body. On my first day in high school, the clamp somehow came undone and I had formulastomach acid all over my brand new jeans.

" When DS was a baby and adeks switched the formula to create Aquadeks drops, Id gag every time Id put it in the oral syringe. Smelled like someone had a sinus infection. Nasty. Fortunately he didnt mind or notice. Switched to Source CF Chewables and then to the softgels. A week ago I ran out of SourceCF and switched to Aquadeks softgels. Every morning this week Ive noticed DSs breath smells different -- like he has a sinus infection. But his nose is clear, no cough, just had cultures run and nothing growing.... Yesterday got his afternoon meds ready and caught a whiff from the bottle of vitamins. Yep, nasty aquadeks smell. Least I know what it is now. But, bleah! "
2230
" They taste even worse than they smell. And if you have even a small burn after taking them...oh boy. I havent been on those vitamins in a little over six months. I finally could no longer stand the taste and decided taking multiple vitamins but not having that taste was worth it.<br> <br> My family always likes to joke that by 2013, youd think scientists would have at least discovered how to make meds that dont taste that horrible.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations.

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me.

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "

" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed.

You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "

" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there.

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years.

Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious.

All original equipment.<br> <br> Flight to Denver at 3 with pneumonia was the short story. Father diagnosed wCF by autopsy, died age 48. Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate. He in fact was total PI and in a very short three months dropped beyond a recoverable weight, and was working the day before he died. As tragic as that sounds, he was an intimidating, brilliant and vibrant man right to the end.<br> <br> My inherited characteristics seems to include that 110 volt system wired for 220.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion.

" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "

" Ive wondered that, too, Pat. Ill be 53 next month &amp, never had one. My fev1 is around 30% right now. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" Ok, did I actually coin CF geezer? Apologies to those who havent noticed, or arent geezers. Born 1950 Wyoming, 63 now and I was diagnosed at age 52 by salt chloride test, heterozygous S1235R. All original equipment.<br> <br> Flight to Denver at 3 with pneumonia was the short story. Father diagnosed wCF by autopsy, died age 48. Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate. He in fact was total PI and in a very short three months dropped beyond a recoverable weight, and was working the day before he died. As tragic as that sounds, he was an intimidating, brilliant and vibrant man right to the end.<br> <br> My inherited characteristics seems to include that 110 volt system wired for 220. Brain without an off switch, whatever, I have truly been there, done that. The ultimate risk taking balls out livaholicworkaholic my work, my body of work and my very fortunate journey has been fantastic, unbelievably difficult and rewarding. <br> <br> Not so much these days but I still have fun.<br> <br> LL "

" Im not 55, but can I play anyway? I turned 49 last May. God willing, Ill hit the big 5-0 next year. I was DX at birth, at Ft. Sam Houston, TX. I thank God my Dad was a Warrant Officer pilot. I think if he had not been in the Army when I was born, I wouldnt be alive today. I had the best medical care Uncle Sam could provide. Although Ive been all over the country, I live in Arizona &amp, have for almost all my life. Subtract the 7 years we were itinerant Army trash. I had to have a double-lung transplant at age 41. Mine, unfortunately, did not go as planned. Ive had what seems to be unceasing complications since then. The latest is I was facing a liver TX yesterday. Thank God my TX Doc called today &amp, told me the problem can be controlled with a new med. Anyway, thats my story &amp, Im sticking to it. Thanks for reading my rambling statement... Pat. "

" I am a certified 65.9 year old CF geezer. I about gave it up at 9 weeks with double pneumonia. My Mom was a trooper and got me out of it somehow (1947). My brother and sister both also had CF. I just had the gene test and doc didnt tell me what combo, just that I didnt qualify for the new genetically targeted med. My FEV 1 is now about 40 but I still exercise. I have a nice recumbent trike and I walk with my sweetest wife of 44 years.<br> <br> I just restarted digestive enzymes after a 25 year pause. Not for weight issues but for increasing gas....puuff....ahem....now I can add cancer (high PSA) high blood pressure, and a bad low hernia (probably from years of coughing my brains into mush, did I mention short term memory) and other minor old folks health issues to my list of lifes challenges...Lol "

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 50 I am 57 now always a little sick as a child but not so sick that I was in the hospital I always had problems with food and digestion Had Gall bladder removed at 19 years and gall stones kidney stones,But mostly lung infections and bad inmune system "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe. I guess I learned how to take care of my problems even though I didnt know anything about CF. "

" I was diagnosed at 43 after 6 episodes of pancreatitis within a 6 month period. Finally had genetic testing and positive sweat test.

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "
1065
" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "
8261
" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "
6072
" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly.

" All changes regarding CF are described in section 3.04, which I am copying and pasting below. Or you can read it at: <a href=\\http:www.regulations.gov#!documentDetail"
7289
" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "
4585
" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "
12130
" Ive wondered that, too, Pat. Ill be 53 next month &amp, never had one. My fev1 is around 30% right now. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "

" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step.

I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "

" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step.

I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate. He in fact was total PI and in a very short three months dropped beyond a recoverable weight, and was working the day before he died. As tragic as that sounds, he was an intimidating, brilliant and vibrant man right to the end.<br> <br> My inherited characteristics seems to include that 110 volt system wired for 220.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I hated the smell and taste as well. The adult ADEK pills are also very large so not fun to swallow. My doctor said I could instead take one Flintstones vitamin and a vitamin E. Im not sure what the equivalent is for a childs dose. "

" Fortunately he doesnt seem to mind the smell. Im primarily concerned that he get adequate Vitamin D and adeks is comparable to Source CF, whereas Vitamax is severely lacking in most of the fat solubles -- not really sure why its even considered a CF vitamin. He takes two adeks softgels a day, plus a vitamin E (400 IU), vitamin A (10,000 IU) daily and a 5 mg tablet of vitamin K (mephyton) weekly. I figured if it became an issue, Id speak with his doctor about comparable vitamins. Im just glad I figured out it was the vitamin causing his breath to smell, was worried he had a sinus or other infection. "

" You guys had me all freaked out re a brewing battle to come when we had to change over last week when we used our last CF Source. DS took without an issue.

" My daughter was on Aquadeks a couple of years ago and we noticed a strange (bad) smell coming from her. She was in 5th grade and it was just sweating out of her. It took us awhile to figure out it was the vitamins. I took one sniff od the cap and realized it was the same smell. Since we can no longer get Source CF she has to take the Vitamax chewables which she hates but not as much as smelling bad. Weird thing is that my son who also took the Aquadeks, didnt have the same reaction that his sister did. "

" Im not talking about FEV1 needed to be considered for evaluation, but to actually be transplanted.

" I am in Canada and have 24% lung function and have been on the list just over a year.<br> <br> Dave, "
3323
" Thanks Dave. And you could get lungs anytime since youve been on the list right? Here they have 2 lists: the normal list and the high urgency list. Only people in the high urgency list can get lungs and those have to be really sick and close to dying. "
1032
" Hoi Vera, <br> <br> Those numbers arent set in stone here. It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in. But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. "
7536
" Hi twistofchaos. I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. "
1032
" Hiya, <br> <br> Its relevant if you want to figure out how many transplants are actually done on people with CF. <br> I agree ofcourse that the whole transplant system has to be hugely improved, and mainly that donorship has to be the default for everyone till one objects and some specific exceptions. Which would solve a lot and its something that is proposed every few years here in politics but never quite makes it. <br> <br> Anyway in the US 1 per 3700 people are born with CF. <br> In the Netherlands thats 1 per 4750. <br> <br> So help me figure out how more people with CF get transplanted when you dont have a huge increase in transplants especially compared to the higher % of people with CF in the population. <br> Fewer people get screenedgo on the transplantlists in the US at all? "
7536
" I maintain that out of everyone waiting for a transplant in the US and in the NL, in the US they have a higher chance of receiving one. Not only do the numbers speak for themselves (I stated those in a previous reply), but just the fact that people in the US are able to receive lungs for a period of over 1 year or 2 and still be alive (a lot of them) at the end of that period shows that the chances there are higher. Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me. Due do shortage, you only get on the high urgency list (when you are finally able to receive lungs if they become available) when you are extremely sick and close to death. <br> I was also informed that due to my height (53&quot,), it will be even harder for me to get lungs that are suitable in the Netherlands because everyone is much taller than me. This presents another problem. "
1032
" Ok, <br> <br> About 4 million people are born in America a year. (some would call them babies)<br> In the Netherlands about 190.000 people are born a year.

Then what gives? Thats not cynical, Im curious. <br> They were doing transplants in the US earlier (1969) but weve been doing them for a while here as well (1990, and since 2001 in 3 locations) so Im not sure how in 2013 we still have a 200+% demand here but not in the US. <br> <br> Anyway but my parents always saved a lot and me and my sister were indeed raised from early age with the idea to save money if one day we had to go to the US (or another country) if we would need a transplant. To be able pay for it ourselves. Still always live with that idea when it comes to spending money and so CF turned me into a terrible cheapskate. That by the way counts his savings at night in the dark with nothing but a flickering candleflame softly laughing with always suddenly a thunderstorm over my house out of nowhere when I do that. Weird. "

" Youre still focusing on the total number of people with cf and newborns etc, and not on the number of people on a transplant list at any given time. It doesnt matter if 1000 people are born with cf or not, what matters is how many of those will be on the transplant list at the same time (as far as what my question is, Im sure your numbers count towards different studies).

" IN THE NEWS: Sarah Murnaghan, a ten-year old with cystic fibrosis, needs a lung transplant. She has weeks to live. Federal policy requires a child must be at least twelve years old to be on the adult transplant list. Sarah wont live to twelve without the transplant.Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Kathleen Sebelius, has asked for a review of the policy but has said it will takes years to make any changes. The HHS Chief of Staffs telephone number is 202690-8157. I called to voice my opinion and they transferred me to a hot-line for the Office of the Secretary where I was permitted to leave a message. I dont know that it will help Sarah, but it was worth a try. I encourage you to call and voice your opinion. "

" Well, we are getting a good first glimpse of Obamacare.<font color=\\#333333\\\"> Kathleen Sebelius could waive the age rule for this girl but she has decided not to. The fact that one person has that much power over someones life is horrifying. <br> <br> <font>http:thinkprogress.orghealth201306052104921sarah-murnaghan-denied-lung-transplant \""
5003
" This has nothing to do with &quot,Obamacare&quot, - this has everything to do with the organ allocation system. Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered.

" Obviously this girls doctors thought she was an acceptable candidate for adult lungs its just her age that caused the issue and a technicality like that shouldnt decide if a person lives or dies. Its just an example that one size rules do not fit all. And whats even more concerning is the CFFs lack of advocacy I mean even if they were against this girl getting a transplant Id like to hear them say it. They are our biggest advocate and yet they stayed silent. Even in the response they put out they say they want to leave the decision between the doctor and patient. Well, the doctor and patient thought this girl should have a transplant and this one rule stopped them. "
5003
" I know this is a very sensitive issue but has anyone considered that the &quot,age&quot, rule was developed in 2005. I dont think it should be about age as much as body size and mass. Lung transplantation is very tricky, much more difficult than a kidney or liver. A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off. Is this case just about age or about the disgraceful lack of organ donors in general? "

" Three of the past four days, Ive woken up with a sharp pain under the lower part of my right rib cage, more toward my back than front. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and knows what it is. Its not my usual lung-related pain, because its not worse when I inhale, and my mucus is about the same. I did have a low fever and aches one of the days, but am not sure if thats relevant. <br> <br> So, in the morning, I wake up and the pain is maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but once Im up-up, its like a 0-3. And by three or four pm, its completely gone--UNLESS (heres the weird thing) I swallow a big bite of food. A few seconds after swallowing, I get a flash of pain in the area.<br> <br> Im not nauseous or having out of the ordinary GI symptoms. Im exercising like normal too--went rock climbing one of the days and did zumba another. Lying down and pushing my back into the floor makes it hurt more. So I was thinking a muscle thing, but the food-swallow thing is odd.<br> <br> Any ideas? "

" I vote for gallbladder too. I had a good friend whose gall bladder was inflamed and the symptoms sound similar. With her we had to take her to the ER and eventually she had to get surgery. Hope thats not your situation but food for thought. "
1065
" My first thought was gallstones as well, but it is possible that it could be pleurisy.<br> <br> I had my gallbladder removed about 8 years ago. I didnt have stabbing back pain or anything - BUT back pain on the right side below the shoulder is common with gallstones and gallbladder issues. I would get symptoms similar to anxiety attacks, tightness in my chest and pain when I would try to breathe. I would also get nausea and vomiting as time passed. For my I had attacks and symptoms directly related to drinking soda or any carbonated beverage. That being said a lot of people get symptoms when they eat, but symptoms and attacks are often associated with eating fatty foods or greasy foods. <br> <br> I hope it is nothing and that it goes away, but I would definitely bring it up to your doc and ask if they can check it out if it continues. As for pleurisy it is usually a result of infection but just because you arent coughing more or dont have excess mucus doesnt mean anything. If you have an infection and any area of the lung tissue is inflamed it can result in pleurisy.<br> <br> Hope you start feeling better soon. "

" My son has cf and autism. Because of the autism this child does not sleep. We did try melintonin, which is an over he counter herbal remedy. Totally safe, his doc. suggested it. Unfortunately he fell asleep but woke at 3 am ready to start his day. He now takes a very low dose of clonidine (0.2 mg). That helps him fall asleep, stay asleep, and not feel groggy or foggy the next day. I would suggest trying the melintonin first. You can get it any pharmacy. Probably should check with our doctor first though. Good luck! "

She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates.

If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself.

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years.

Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours.

Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "

I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "

" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner.

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

We work on empowerment as well as legal issues, and most of all coping. I get called out to the hosp. at all hours of the night to be with the survivor. <br> <br> This always stops the conversation ASAP because people dont know what to say. But there is a need for it, so I do it. <br> <br> <br> <br> So, what interesting jobs do you all have?&lt,hr&gt,&lt,blockquote&gt,<br> <br> You have an interesting job. I dont have one, for certain reasons. (But NOT BECAUSE IM A BUM! &lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-smile.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt, )<br> <br> &lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-cool.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt,&lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsgas.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt,&lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-happy.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt, "

" I have been a stay at home Mom &amp, Domestic Goddess for the last 5 years. Previous to that I had worked at our local hospital in the admissions &amp, billing departments. In addition to assuring accurate info about the patients, I verified insurance &amp, contacted companies for approval &amp, started paperwork for those without insurance for them to get assistance. I was there for 12 years. Previous to that I was the Senior Dispatcher at an Answering Service which was assisting our new 911 Center with the transfer of responses to calls for local fire, ambulance &amp, police calls. I was there for 1 12 years. I would have stayed, but when I finally became eligible for insurance (which took a year of employment), I was told for my CF to be covered I would have another year waiting period. I knew I couldnt risk it so I left. My job before that which was my first job ever &amp, my first job out of high school was Assistant Legal Secretary at a local law firm. The criminal attorney is who I worked for &amp, it was very interesting because of our large range of clientel. Everything from DWI to Ohio Mafia. I thank my High School PrincipalScience teacher for giving me a good recommendation on that. The girl who hired me for the law firm was my Principals neighbor. I left there because the Senior lawyer (who was 79) &amp, I clashed big time. I was still young &amp, didnt like to be bellowed to &amp, expect to be a servant like his secretary of many years was. He &amp, I had a meeting one day after a blow up &amp, he kept saying &quot, I dont want anyone to lose their job, I dont want anyone to have to lose their job.&quot, Obviously it wasnt him who would lose his job since he owned the firm, building etc. So I quit. The joys of being young with no responsibilities. I was there for 1 12 years. Thats my employment stories! "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants.

Sometimes they just come over to my house and we have pizza movie days, or lay out in the sun. Also my family is a big part of what keeps me feeling pretty good. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene.

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe. I guess I learned how to take care of my problems even though I didnt know anything about CF. "

" I was diagnosed at 43 after 6 episodes of pancreatitis within a 6 month period. Finally had genetic testing and positive sweat test. Always have had sinus issues, thought it was allergies my whole life! I saw a specialist in Boston and found out that a lot of people get diagnosed as adults. Never knew. "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "
1065
" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "
8261
" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "
4585
" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "
12130
" Ive wondered that, too, Pat. Ill be 53 next month &amp, never had one. My fev1 is around 30% right now. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26.

Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations.

Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "
1065
" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "
8261
" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly.

" All changes regarding CF are described in section 3.04, which I am copying and pasting below. Or you can read it at: <a href=\\http:www.regulations.gov#!documentDetail"

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" They way I think about it, EVERYONE has something. Be it CF, or some other weight. Depression, a tough childhood, you name it. Its the baggage that people bring to the table.

Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

All original equipment.<br> <br> Flight to Denver at 3 with pneumonia was the short story. Father diagnosed wCF by autopsy, died age 48. Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate. He in fact was total PI and in a very short three months dropped beyond a recoverable weight, and was working the day before he died. As tragic as that sounds, he was an intimidating, brilliant and vibrant man right to the end.<br> <br> My inherited characteristics seems to include that 110 volt system wired for 220.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "

" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "
6815
" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "

" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed. "

" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "
11475
" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" I am getting an extensive CT scan with dye contrast and chalk drink. Doctor is going to check for hernias and abnormalitiesscaring from previous surgeries.

I guess the chair is the lesser of the evils. "
14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" They way I think about it, EVERYONE has something. Be it CF, or some other weight. Depression, a tough childhood, you name it. Its the baggage that people bring to the table. The key here is, how do you DEAL with it? <br> <br> My advice to you is: keep doing what youre doing! It sounds like you are an extremely kind person and you like this girl a lot. Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 50 I am 57 now always a little sick as a child but not so sick that I was in the hospital I always had problems with food and digestion Had Gall bladder removed at 19 years and gall stones kidney stones,But mostly lung infections and bad inmune system "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe. I guess I learned how to take care of my problems even though I didnt know anything about CF. "

" I was diagnosed at 43 after 6 episodes of pancreatitis within a 6 month period. Finally had genetic testing and positive sweat test. Always have had sinus issues, thought it was allergies my whole life! I saw a specialist in Boston and found out that a lot of people get diagnosed as adults. Never knew. "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "
1065
" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "
8261
" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly. I am a living breathing example of how me not working in a full time capacity allows me to care for myself. &quot"

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26.

Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "
15443
" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Look up inclined bed therapy. You can put your headboard on risers so that the whole bed is inclined, yet your back will be helped because you are sort of still lying flat. My husband and I are currently trying this because he snores and this supposedly helps. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed. "
6072
" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "
11475
" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" I am getting an extensive CT scan with dye contrast and chalk drink. Doctor is going to check for hernias and abnormalitiesscaring from previous surgeries. I am also going through the early stages of &quot,the change&quot,... my body is in huge stage of stress. Hoping to find out soon. Tried sleeping in bed all propped up and had acid reflux. I guess the chair is the lesser of the evils. "
14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

I was thinking about it after reading the topic of &quot,calling in sick.&quot,<br> <br> So lets share what kinds of jobs we do, if we work from home, etc.<br> <br> To start: I work in a Rape Crisis office, where Im an advocate for women who have been sexually assaulted. We work on empowerment as well as legal issues, and most of all coping. I get called out to the hosp. at all hours of the night to be with the survivor. <br> <br> This always stops the conversation ASAP because people dont know what to say. But there is a need for it, so I do it. <br> <br> <br> <br> So, what interesting jobs do you all have?&lt,hr&gt,&lt,blockquote&gt,<br> <br> You have an interesting job. I dont have one, for certain reasons. (But NOT BECAUSE IM A BUM! &lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-smile.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt, )<br> <br> &lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-cool.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt,&lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsgas.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt,&lt,img src=&quot,iexpressionsface-icon-small-happy.gif&quot, border=&quot,0&quot,&gt, "

" I have been a stay at home Mom &amp, Domestic Goddess for the last 5 years. Previous to that I had worked at our local hospital in the admissions &amp, billing departments. In addition to assuring accurate info about the patients, I verified insurance &amp, contacted companies for approval &amp, started paperwork for those without insurance for them to get assistance. I was there for 12 years. Previous to that I was the Senior Dispatcher at an Answering Service which was assisting our new 911 Center with the transfer of responses to calls for local fire, ambulance &amp, police calls. I was there for 1 12 years. I would have stayed, but when I finally became eligible for insurance (which took a year of employment), I was told for my CF to be covered I would have another year waiting period. I knew I couldnt risk it so I left. My job before that which was my first job ever &amp, my first job out of high school was Assistant Legal Secretary at a local law firm. The criminal attorney is who I worked for &amp, it was very interesting because of our large range of clientel. Everything from DWI to Ohio Mafia. I thank my High School PrincipalScience teacher for giving me a good recommendation on that. The girl who hired me for the law firm was my Principals neighbor. I left there because the Senior lawyer (who was 79) &amp, I clashed big time. I was still young &amp, didnt like to be bellowed to &amp, expect to be a servant like his secretary of many years was. He &amp, I had a meeting one day after a blow up &amp, he kept saying &quot, I dont want anyone to lose their job, I dont want anyone to have to lose their job.&quot, Obviously it wasnt him who would lose his job since he owned the firm, building etc. So I quit. The joys of being young with no responsibilities. I was there for 1 12 years. Thats my employment stories! "

" Since Im so close to needing a transplant, I have been doing more hospital rounds and Iv rounds at home. I have done the iv rounds about 15 times in about 2 12 years. once i start getting my work and social life together along with my strength, i get sick again. Im getting frustratedsaddiscouraged about this. Does Anyone get this way? WhAt do u do to stop being frustratedsaddiscouraged ? ita hard because i cant work as much or do things socially. feel out of the loop in my social circl sometimes. "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants. I would be a wreck if it wasnt for Zoloft. "

" I agree with nocode. I thought I would be so bored when I had to quit my jobs, but when I got to this point doing all my treatments has become my job. As for doing stuff with friends, I go out when I have the energy. Usually just to lunch or a movie or something. Sometimes they just come over to my house and we have pizza movie days, or lay out in the sun. Also my family is a big part of what keeps me feeling pretty good. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" They way I think about it, EVERYONE has something. Be it CF, or some other weight. Depression, a tough childhood, you name it. Its the baggage that people bring to the table. The key here is, how do you DEAL with it? <br> <br> My advice to you is: keep doing what youre doing! It sounds like you are an extremely kind person and you like this girl a lot. Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,. Most of the time CF plays a background role in my life. But every now and then, it rears its ugly head. Maybe I get sick and am down for the count for a couple days. Maybe I read an update of someone I know who passes away from it. Maybe I have a rough dr. appointment. The best thing you can do is be there and listen. Be available for hugs.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

Well, not exactly, the doctor summed the condition of his organs etc without a defined diagnosis, that was traced after my diagnosis. Lived my younger years in an oxygenvapor tent off and on. I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "

" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "

" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "

" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "
6815
" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "
15443
" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Look up inclined bed therapy. You can put your headboard on risers so that the whole bed is inclined, yet your back will be helped because you are sort of still lying flat. My husband and I are currently trying this because he snores and this supposedly helps. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed.

" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "

" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "

" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" I am getting an extensive CT scan with dye contrast and chalk drink. Doctor is going to check for hernias and abnormalitiesscaring from previous surgeries. I am also going through the early stages of &quot,the change&quot,... my body is in huge stage of stress. Hoping to find out soon. Tried sleeping in bed all propped up and had acid reflux. I guess the chair is the lesser of the evils. "
14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" I have been a stay at home Mom &amp, Domestic Goddess for the last 5 years. Previous to that I had worked at our local hospital in the admissions &amp, billing departments. In addition to assuring accurate info about the patients, I verified insurance &amp, contacted companies for approval &amp, started paperwork for those without insurance for them to get assistance. I was there for 12 years. Previous to that I was the Senior Dispatcher at an Answering Service which was assisting our new 911 Center with the transfer of responses to calls for local fire, ambulance &amp, police calls. I was there for 1 12 years. I would have stayed, but when I finally became eligible for insurance (which took a year of employment), I was told for my CF to be covered I would have another year waiting period. I knew I couldnt risk it so I left. My job before that which was my first job ever &amp, my first job out of high school was Assistant Legal Secretary at a local law firm. The criminal attorney is who I worked for &amp, it was very interesting because of our large range of clientel. Everything from DWI to Ohio Mafia. I thank my High School PrincipalScience teacher for giving me a good recommendation on that. The girl who hired me for the law firm was my Principals neighbor. I left there because the Senior lawyer (who was 79) &amp, I clashed big time. I was still young &amp, didnt like to be bellowed to &amp, expect to be a servant like his secretary of many years was. He &amp, I had a meeting one day after a blow up &amp, he kept saying &quot, I dont want anyone to lose their job, I dont want anyone to have to lose their job.&quot, Obviously it wasnt him who would lose his job since he owned the firm, building etc. So I quit.

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants.

Im really not trying to get in the way of my family having a fun trip, but all I want to do at this point is sleep. Were in Yellowstone at the moment, the altitude is too high for me to do much, and an afternoon where we arent <i>having<i> to do something would be like a gift from the gods. "

" your body tells you what it needs. Dont let others give you advice about your body - people, who do not have the slightest idea what CF means to your body. We are constantly fighting germs and bacteria, our lungs are working double if not triple duty - more than any &quot,normal&quot, body. That takes energy. You get energy when you recover and sleep. Just take a nap.<br> My in-laws never understand that I need to rest - they do not see anything physical wrong with me and taking a nap is a sign of weakness or sign of old age to them.<br> Screw them - its my health and my body!

" But you look fine? Enjoy the days when nobody sees how hard you work. If it were my parents, Id wait until about bedtime and piss them off with something that will keep them awake. Do this nightly until you have the advantage.<br> <br> Once they cant keep from destroying a room for a lost bill or such, its time to turn the tables. If a clear statement that you need 9 hours of sleep daily is beyond comprehension you need heavy guns to make your point. Skip meals to catch up sleep. Eat on the road with some take out orders, filled while the folks eat. If this takes too long, lower your expectations. Not really, but you are grouchy, a sign of fatigue. Maybe you should save energy holding your tongue.<br> <br> A medical answer, 8 to 9 hours sleep at a minimum for some average CFer.

" Yep I need a lot of sleep. 8-10 hours minimum on normal days and it quickly increases with significant activity or decreased health. Can go one or two nights with less but it quickly catches up with me. <br> Depending on where you are at with your health CF is tiring on the body, activity counts double and our bodies need the recoverytime. <br> <br> Trips are wonderful especially active ones but you do need the rest. Nothing much to do about that. If not you simply stop functioning after a few days or get actually sick. When traveling with a group they either have to keep you in consideration or you could skip a day and rest at the hotel. <br> <br> Went to Norway recently and on active trips like that I get up early-ish, 6 or 7 and then Im active through the day. (Walk, travel, see things) But then I have no choice but to head back to the hotel after dinnertime and try to be in bed with lights out at 9 or so in the evening. Who cares, had a great trip where all went well and all that I really missed out on were the drunk Norwegian women at night. .. ohh "

" Has anyone coughed up tissue from their lungs before? This is a first for me and it is a little disturbing. "
5439
" You should be telling this to your CF Specialist!!!! "
9620
" I spoke with the RN who says it is probably sputum. However I am a nurse too and it doesnt look like it to me. They said just keep an eye on it to see if there are any changes. Maybe I am just worrying too much. "
5439
" How did it look like if you dont mind me asking? I coughed up something weird a while back and still not sure what it was. It was hard, dark brown, and large as a pebble and foul tasting. "
9249
" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "
5439
" If it continues, have it tested. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" I love music...not talented in it, but LOVE to listen to lyrics and the beat. When my doctor retired back maybe 15ish years ago (when CFers could still hang out) we had a big party for him. They played &quot,Hero&quot, by Mariah Carey. So that song has a very special memory for me.<br> <br> Also, &quot,My wish for you&quot, by Rascall Flatts. It was popular when my friend Kay got her tx (she later passed away). It always makes me think of her. "

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" I never had that. Ask your doctor if you can culture it next time you see it.

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "
2483
" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

Every morning this week Ive noticed DSs breath smells different -- like he has a sinus infection. But his nose is clear, no cough, just had cultures run and nothing growing.... Yesterday got his afternoon meds ready and caught a whiff from the bottle of vitamins. Yep, nasty aquadeks smell. Least I know what it is now. But, bleah! "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "
15443
" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "

" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Look up inclined bed therapy. You can put your headboard on risers so that the whole bed is inclined, yet your back will be helped because you are sort of still lying flat. My husband and I are currently trying this because he snores and this supposedly helps. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed. "
6072
" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "
11475
" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" I am getting an extensive CT scan with dye contrast and chalk drink. Doctor is going to check for hernias and abnormalitiesscaring from previous surgeries. I am also going through the early stages of &quot,the change&quot,... my body is in huge stage of stress. Hoping to find out soon. Tried sleeping in bed all propped up and had acid reflux. I guess the chair is the lesser of the evils. "
14045
" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" Since Im so close to needing a transplant, I have been doing more hospital rounds and Iv rounds at home. I have done the iv rounds about 15 times in about 2 12 years. once i start getting my work and social life together along with my strength, i get sick again. Im getting frustratedsaddiscouraged about this. Does Anyone get this way? WhAt do u do to stop being frustratedsaddiscouraged ? ita hard because i cant work as much or do things socially. feel out of the loop in my social circl sometimes. "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants. I would be a wreck if it wasnt for Zoloft. "

" I agree with nocode. I thought I would be so bored when I had to quit my jobs, but when I got to this point doing all my treatments has become my job. As for doing stuff with friends, I go out when I have the energy. Usually just to lunch or a movie or something. Sometimes they just come over to my house and we have pizza movie days, or lay out in the sun. Also my family is a big part of what keeps me feeling pretty good. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently.

When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

I knew whatever had shortened my fathers life was also my genetics but like my doctors, figured it was just some seriously annoying health issues. <br> <br> I actually believed my father worked himself to death and that was to be my fate. He in fact was total PI and in a very short three months dropped beyond a recoverable weight, and was working the day before he died. As tragic as that sounds, he was an intimidating, brilliant and vibrant man right to the end.<br> <br> My inherited characteristics seems to include that 110 volt system wired for 220. Brain without an off switch, whatever, I have truly been there, done that. The ultimate risk taking balls out livaholicworkaholic my work, my body of work and my very fortunate journey has been fantastic, unbelievably difficult and rewarding. <br> <br> Not so much these days but I still have fun.<br> <br> LL "

" Ok yesterday at clinic someone asked how old I was and replied 43. Not as old as you are asking about but nonetheless they said keep up the good work. Just thought Id pass along that us 40+ are growing in numbers and now have a better shot with these new drugs coming out. Hang in there and stay well. "

Although Ive been all over the country, I live in Arizona &amp, have for almost all my life. Subtract the 7 years we were itinerant Army trash. I had to have a double-lung transplant at age 41. Mine, unfortunately, did not go as planned. Ive had what seems to be unceasing complications since then. The latest is I was facing a liver TX yesterday.

" I was diagnosed at 32. Been sick my whole life, but not sick enough to be diagnosed with CF. Had colds, flu, runny nose my whole life. What lead to diagnosis was that I kept getting pnemonia, had suspicious cultures and wanted to know what was wrong with me. Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26. Could be my mutations are not that severe but I think that I stayed healthy because I was always running or swimming. Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited. Hope that you are doing well this summer. ( I am 51 now, and have 2 R117H and R560T) "

" I was diagnosed at 34. I had been treated for asthma my entire life. Leading up to my diagnosis, I started to get lung infections that the antibiotics were no longer treating. After trying many things, I was referred to a respirologist. They tested me for CF (genetically) and it came back positive. The infection that they couldnt treat was pseudomonas, which cleared up once treated with the proper medication.<br> <br> I am pancreatic sufficient, which made it easy to explain my lung symptoms as asthma. In addition, I show up as negative with sweat tests. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

" I was diagnosed when I was 36 years old. It was such a relief as I finally knew what was &quot,wrong&quot, with me. looking back I had not the typically CF symptoms but many &quot,indicators&quot, such as appendicitis, gall stones, nasal polyps and the ever re-occurring colds and coughs. when I was 36 I tried to get pregnant and the doc said &quot, not even the best sperm can get thru that mucus wall&quot, which was the main indicator for a CF condition. We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I was diagnosed last year at age 34 due to infertility. I was frequently ill growing up and always under-sized and under-weight for my age. I struggled with pneumonia, sinusitis, and bronchitis, along with digestive issues of gas and constipation. Strangely, I have been much healthier as an adult and many of my symptoms are less severe. I guess I learned how to take care of my problems even though I didnt know anything about CF. "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "

" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "

" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "

" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me. After all, I was falling in love with her. She was so happy then. The joy in her big eyes was definitely there. You would never once think to look at her that she has this internal war waging on her body."

" Hello<i>,<br> <i><br> I am a 27 year old who recently had a few gallbladder attacks and found out that I have multiple gallbladder stones and a contracted gallbladder via ultrasound. Iwent to see a GI surgeon today. He was referred to me by my CF specialist. I was not very happy with the consultation and the bottom line was that surgeon was not comfortable with operating on me because I had Meconium Ileus when I was born and so 27 years later I have a lot of scar tissue. The surgeon really needed to consult with me CF specialist before we schedule any procedures. I was very frustrated when I left the office because I felt that I really did not get any answers and the surgeon did not know anything about CF. <br> I thought I would post on this forum and see if anyone has had a similar issue with gallbladder attacks and stones or if anyone else had Meconium Ileus? How are you doing now? Also if anyone knows of a good GI surgeon in NJ, NY or PA that has experience with CF complications that would be very helpful. "

" DS hasnt had gallbladder issues yet, however, his doctor did indicate once he was in his teens that they would start doing ultrasounds on his gallbladder due to potential issues. Currently he takes actigall, which apparently helps to a certain extent. I would ask your CF specialist to refer you to GI specialist familiar with CF being that this one doesnt seem to have a clue. "
2230
" Thanks, I did ask my CF specialist to refer me to a GI guy that knows about CF. I was just surprised that he didnt do that in the first place. Thats great that your sons Dr. is being proactive. My Dr. never even mentioned it to me. I have always had different GI symptoms and when I had the gallbladder attack I was the one that brought up the possibility of gallstones to my Dr. Im just frustrated that the my CF team doesnt have a referral base of people that know and can help patients that have CF. CF effects every organ in the body and Im sure Im not the only CF patient that has had gallbladder problems. Im just frustrated with the lack of patient care and knowledge of CF. "
15443
" I had my gallbladder out a few years ago when I was around 25. I have a lot of scar tissue also from the ilieostomy surgery also and my surgeon was concerned about it thinking there was a chance he wouldnt be able to get it out laprascopically and might have to be open abdominal surgery. Fortunately he did a great job, I do have about 5 incisions all around my stomach for different viewing angles so he could see around the car tissue, although they are all only about half an inch , and theres one under my breastbone where he pulled it out from that scar is about an inch. I was back to normal after about a week , getting rid of the gas from them inflating the belly was almost the worst. I had some back pain because I couldnt stand up straight for about a week. <br> <br> Its nice not to have the attacks anymore , my gallbladder problems started when I was pregnant and the first attack I thought it was contractions because of the pain came on and intensified and then would come down and then repeat minutes later. I also was throwing up green bile, yuck. <br> <br> Since I take enzymes I was able to resume my normal fatty diet. I know people without cf have to limit fat after this surgery since the gallbladder helps digest fats. Good luck!! "

" Ive had mine out almost two years ago. Was a HUGE relief. I thought I was dying when I would have attacks (okay, maybe not that bad, but it is the worst pain Ive ever been in physically). I went to ER for morphine until I would pass out. I didnt have MI as a baby so I didnt have that issue.<br> <br> The surgery was so easy, pretty painless, and I was home the same day. The only thing was, I had to go on oral antibiotics because I wasnt able to cough and do treatments because it would hurt so bad. The gas they use to blow you up with is what is painful the day of the surgery. You feel like a balloon that will explode. <br> <br> If you are in bad shape as far as feeling sick, fight for a good surgeon. The surgery is well worth it. I dont have a weight issue, but I avoid SUPER fatty foods often (mostly I dont like it, but also because it makes me have diarrhea). "

" Thanks for the replies. I am not having any pain or attacks since last Monday so im happy for that. I just finished 2 weeks of iv antibiotics for an exacerbation that took my fev1 down to 40%. Im back up to 60% now which is close to my baseline. So I thought now would be a good time to have the surgery when Im at my best and I still have the picc in. Im just not getting the help I need from my dr. Are you guys in the tri state area? Who was your surgeon? Or do you have any names of good GI surgeons that also are familiar with CF? I dont want to make a quick decision on this but I also dont want to get caught in an emergency situation and then my fev1 is low and recovery will be difficult. Just waiting to hear from my Dr. And hopefully he was able to talk to the GI guy and they came up with a plan. Thanks in advance for any advice and recommendations. "
15443
" What state are you from? Where is your CF center? "

" If any problem exists from prior surgeries, the only difference should be laproscopic surgery or conventional. Find another surgeon. In the worst case, and it is a difference of 23hr operationrecovery or 12 days with a conventional incision. Gallbladders are removed every day from tripple bypassed, morbidly obese people. You may be frustrated by this but surgeons are all over the place.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" yup I had the same problem. I now have a gen. practitioner that also is a pulmonary specialist, then I go into the cf clinic 1-2 times a yr to stay current on the new stuff. My gp found thyroid disease, blockage. gallbladderappendix issues, and severe allergy to grass. I felt like a whole new person when all that was taken care of! I was pretty upset at first cuz the cf clinic told me that I was sick because of my cf and just had to accept this new baseline. "
15436
" My surgeon wasnt even a GI specific surgeon just a general surgeon, Jeffry Zern, and I am in Delaware. I agree that you should just find a different surgeon who is more optimistic and comfortable with your situation. I agree with getting it now when you are just off ivs and at your baseline instead of waiting until its an emergency or more urgent surgery and you may not be feeling so well.

" I have horrible acid reflux and it gets down into my lungs. My doc said I need to sleep in the recliner. I have been doing so for over 6 months. I am in horrible pain from that recliner. It is firm but soft and... miserable. My legs cramp all through the night. My back is a total mess (I am seeing a spine doc next week for the pain) and even my arms go numb during the night.<br> <br> I have tried sleeping in bed with lots of pillows. I slide down all night long until I am flat. Have tried sleeping with numerous pillows. We have tried all sorts of pillows... soft one and firm ones. I have to sleep at greater than 30 degrees (almost sitting up). <br> <br> I get uncovered during the night and my joints end up cold and stiff. <br> <br> I have cuddled with my husband at night in our bed and my back feels great... the acid reflux does not. The acid reflux contributed to the hole in my lung. Lying flat is the only way my back feels good at the present time. <br> <br> I am at my wits end. I am exhausted from lack of sleep and my morning blood sugars are horrible as I am not getting good sleep. <br> <br> I am concerned that that spine doc is not going to agree with lung doc on the sleeping in the chair. I am also looking at getting hip surgery and am not sure I will be able to get in and out of the recliner (it is deep and I am quite petite). <br> <br> HELP!!! My husband and I feel like we have tried everything and are both frustrated. Our marriage is suffering because we no longer sleep together. "

" Look up inclined bed therapy. You can put your headboard on risers so that the whole bed is inclined, yet your back will be helped because you are sort of still lying flat. My husband and I are currently trying this because he snores and this supposedly helps. "

" Have you looked into that nissen funduplication surgery? <br> <br> I have been disobeying the recommendation of Natl Jewish for several years, but my reflux is likely not as bad as yours. They told me to buy an adjustable bed because of &quot,spontaneous high grade reflux&quot, and some &quot,second wave&quot, something. Like you I tried pillows instead and hated how my body (and my lungs too) felt. The mucus felt cemented in my lower lobes when I slept like that and my hips hurt and I got a yeast infection from my crotch being squished in one place all night.<br> <br> Definitely try Moxie1s advice of putting stuff under the feet at the head of your bed. "
6072
" Do you take anything for your reflux? I suffered for years with that debilitating pain and then started taking lansoprazole (prevacid) BID and have no more pain. Thank goodness. "
11475
" You didnt mention any meds, but I hope you are on something for the reflux. I know that even with meds mine sometimes gets way out of control. Restricting my diet helps some. You may be forced to consider the nissen surgery. I considered it for some time, but decided against it for me. We did buy a sleep number bed with the adjustable frame. Saved my life! I have chronic back and joint pain too, so it helped with that as well. Being able to comfortably adjust my head and legs without hurting my hips and back has been wonderful. <br> <br> I hope you find a solution, because not sleeping well will definitely cause so many problems. <br> <br> Stacey "

" Everyone has hit what I suggest. GERD, reflux and aspirations used to be my hallmarks. A middle ground might be a bed wedge, I prefer blocking up our headboard since were side sleepers.<br> <br> Protonix and Dexilant are proton pump inhibitors. The stomach acid production is reduced. Many CFers have or develop classic gastritis and gastritis drugs work well. I took Protonix at double the regular maximum an now Dexilant 60mg an hour before bedtime. I then take Zantac 150 at bedtime. This is all done under my GI docs direction. When all this fails, if I have a sour stomach at bedtime or awake in the night with reflux or GERD, the chewable generic for Pepsid Complete soothes and stops it. Pepsid Complete is a good dose of antacid and Pepsids fomatadine (sp?) That was dropped and by popular demand, Walgreens and Rite Aid among other stores carry a store brand.<br> <br> I am somewhat surprised more discussion about GERD and asperation doesnt happen. I have not solved all my GERD but my four average hospitalizations per year coincidentally stopped when my GI doc started me on the above regiment. Considering your misery, I would go with Dexilant 60mg and a morning as well as bedtime Zantac 150. I was automatically put on Dexilant 60mg. When I suggested 30mg he told me if I wanted to play with lower doses, it could be done after the GERD was controlled.<br> <br> I hope I didnt just repeat stuff you already know. Adult GI doctors are not particularly up on CF but GERD and Gastritis are treated the same regardless.<br> <br> Enough heartburn to power light rail,<br> <br> LL "
12928
" I am allergic to most of those meds. Going to try Zantac again (only one I am not allergic to).<br> <br> Getting a CT-scan of my digestive system so should have answers soon. "
14045
" Bloggymom,<br> <br> I wasnt thrilled with Protonix, but Dexilant 30mg standard dosing and my 60mg maximum regular dosing works well. If proton pump inhibitors are not practical, GERD and gastritis have been managed a long time and effective management you are ok with should be available. Most GERDgastritis medicines I took by prescription are OTC today, like Zantac. Any protocol from about 1980 on treats as well as the current generation of PPIs and such.<br> <br> I do mean a protocol, GERD that hasnt been resolved so far with medicines is very serious. Realizing a recliner is the closest thing to a failed treatment, I would be a little cranky and looking for help. I know surgeries have been transforming but a degree of management is needed to prevent it re-occurring. The best tolerable acid reducer probably at the maximum labelled dose. A prescription dose of an OTC acid reducer maybe double the OTC label so if you find one, ask your GI doctor. This may be a point. CFGI doctors are rare but GI problems are treated the same way. A GI doctor will know alternative GERD management, one you likely will tolerate and respond well to.<br> <br> Dont shoot me, but many CFers have emotions directly connected to nerves to the gut. Any chance something beyond the usual on your mind, or maybe an accumulation of the usual is upsetting? Ok,thats answered, I really would like to help and medicines from acid reducers to antacids, half a dozen drug families have been effective for the past thirty some years. You wont find Dexilant in China but they have Pepsid AC and most older drugs.<br> <br> If anybody wants to know some historical protocols, like an Pepsid AC for acid, Gaviscon for heartburn and bentyl for stomach cramps. The latest and greatest is really just the latest. Other drugs were great and for the most part remain so. Zantac deals with a simpler mechansm than Protonix and so on. I and most older CFers have been through it all so I can research effective GERD protocols that were effective from say 1980 on.<br> <br> LL "

" I am getting an extensive CT scan with dye contrast and chalk drink. Doctor is going to check for hernias and abnormalitiesscaring from previous surgeries. I am also going through the early stages of &quot,the change&quot,... my body is in huge stage of stress. Hoping to find out soon. Tried sleeping in bed all propped up and had acid reflux.

" An upper GI CT wcontrast is a good idea, but it seems a little low in the GI tract. I am curious, my GI doc scopes me down through the duodenum, rather than relying on a CT. Sometimes a CT follows if he sees something that could have more within the structure of the pyloric valve for example. You didnt mention prior surgeries in your post and that concerns me. GI surgeries for what, if you dont mind answering? Keep me informed please, this is vexing.<br> <br> LL "

" Hi. <br> I was just wondering what kinds of jobs other CFers have. I was thinking about it after reading the topic of &quot,calling in sick.&quot,<br> So lets share what kinds of jobs we do, if we work from home, etc.<br> To start: I work in a Rape Crisis office, where Im an advocate for women who have been sexually assaulted. We work on empowerment as well as legal issues, and most of all coping.

" I have been a stay at home Mom &amp, Domestic Goddess for the last 5 years. Previous to that I had worked at our local hospital in the admissions &amp, billing departments. In addition to assuring accurate info about the patients, I verified insurance &amp, contacted companies for approval &amp, started paperwork for those without insurance for them to get assistance. I was there for 12 years. Previous to that I was the Senior Dispatcher at an Answering Service which was assisting our new 911 Center with the transfer of responses to calls for local fire, ambulance &amp, police calls. I was there for 1 12 years. I would have stayed, but when I finally became eligible for insurance (which took a year of employment), I was told for my CF to be covered I would have another year waiting period. I knew I couldnt risk it so I left. My job before that which was my first job ever &amp, my first job out of high school was Assistant Legal Secretary at a local law firm. The criminal attorney is who I worked for &amp, it was very interesting because of our large range of clientel. Everything from DWI to Ohio Mafia. I thank my High School PrincipalScience teacher for giving me a good recommendation on that. The girl who hired me for the law firm was my Principals neighbor. I left there because the Senior lawyer (who was 79) &amp, I clashed big time. I was still young &amp, didnt like to be bellowed to &amp, expect to be a servant like his secretary of many years was. He &amp, I had a meeting one day after a blow up &amp, he kept saying &quot, I dont want anyone to lose their job, I dont want anyone to have to lose their job.&quot, Obviously it wasnt him who would lose his job since he owned the firm, building etc. So I quit. The joys of being young with no responsibilities. I was there for 1 12 years. Thats my employment stories! "

" Shifting priorities. I started to get less depressed when my goal wasnt to go out or work anymore. When I had to stop working I finally realized that it was time to focus on my health and on not getting sicker, and then its not so bad when you have to spend so much time working at it. To be honest, I thought my life would be over once I couldnt work anymore but it was actually a blessing because it took a lot of pressure off me every time I got sick and had to miss work.<br> That and anti-depressants.

Can go one or two nights with less but it quickly catches up with me. <br> Depending on where you are at with your health CF is tiring on the body, activity counts double and our bodies need the recoverytime. <br> <br> Trips are wonderful especially active ones but you do need the rest. Nothing much to do about that. If not you simply stop functioning after a few days or get actually sick. When traveling with a group they either have to keep you in consideration or you could skip a day and rest at the hotel. <br> <br> Went to Norway recently and on active trips like that I get up early-ish, 6 or 7 and then Im active through the day. (Walk, travel, see things) But then I have no choice but to head back to the hotel after dinnertime and try to be in bed with lights out at 9 or so in the evening. Who cares, had a great trip where all went well and all that I really missed out on were the drunk Norwegian women at night. .. ohh "

" Hello, I used to need 10-11 hours sleep per night too and I would still wake up exhausted.

" Has anyone coughed up tissue from their lungs before? This is a first for me and it is a little disturbing. "
5439
" You should be telling this to your CF Specialist!!!! "
9620
" I spoke with the RN who says it is probably sputum. However I am a nurse too and it doesnt look like it to me. They said just keep an eye on it to see if there are any changes. Maybe I am just worrying too much. "
5439
" How did it look like if you dont mind me asking? I coughed up something weird a while back and still not sure what it was. It was hard, dark brown, and large as a pebble and foul tasting. "
9249
" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "

" If it continues, have it tested. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" I love music...not talented in it, but LOVE to listen to lyrics and the beat. When my doctor retired back maybe 15ish years ago (when CFers could still hang out) we had a big party for him. They played &quot,Hero&quot, by Mariah Carey. So that song has a very special memory for me.<br> <br> Also, &quot,My wish for you&quot, by Rascall Flatts. It was popular when my friend Kay got her tx (she later passed away). It always makes me think of her. "

" Big Shot by Billy Joel...ever since I was little. Its more my theme song about my triumph in life not expressive of a battle with cf. <br> <br> I remember the first time it really got in my head.

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" I never had that. Ask your doctor if you can culture it next time you see it. You can get a specimen container similar to a sputum cup.<br> <br> When I first read your post, I thought it was ovulation. If this happens only once per month then I say it is ovulation. If it is more often sounds like a CF thing.<br> <br> "

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "
2483
" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

My friends werent too grossed out by that, but then I picked it up, washed it, and put it back in my stomach. My one buddy turned green.<br> <br> Not to long ago I had a huge coughing spell while driving on the highway and my mouth was full of mucus. I rolled down the window to spit but did not have enough wind in my lungs to get it all out. I painted the side of my car!

Fortunately he didnt mind or notice. Switched to Source CF Chewables and then to the softgels. A week ago I ran out of SourceCF and switched to Aquadeks softgels. Every morning this week Ive noticed DSs breath smells different -- like he has a sinus infection. But his nose is clear, no cough, just had cultures run and nothing growing.... Yesterday got his afternoon meds ready and caught a whiff from the bottle of vitamins. Yep, nasty aquadeks smell. Least I know what it is now. But, bleah! "
2230
" They taste even worse than they smell. And if you have even a small burn after taking them...oh boy. I havent been on those vitamins in a little over six months. I finally could no longer stand the taste and decided taking multiple vitamins but not having that taste was worth it.<br> <br> My family always likes to joke that by 2013, youd think scientists would have at least discovered how to make meds that dont taste that horrible.

Im really not trying to get in the way of my family having a fun trip, but all I want to do at this point is sleep.

" your body tells you what it needs. Dont let others give you advice about your body - people, who do not have the slightest idea what CF means to your body. We are constantly fighting germs and bacteria, our lungs are working double if not triple duty - more than any &quot,normal&quot, body. That takes energy. You get energy when you recover and sleep. Just take a nap.<br> My in-laws never understand that I need to rest - they do not see anything physical wrong with me and taking a nap is a sign of weakness or sign of old age to them.<br> Screw them - its my health and my body!

" But you look fine? Enjoy the days when nobody sees how hard you work. If it were my parents, Id wait until about bedtime and piss them off with something that will keep them awake. Do this nightly until you have the advantage.<br> <br> Once they cant keep from destroying a room for a lost bill or such, its time to turn the tables. If a clear statement that you need 9 hours of sleep daily is beyond comprehension you need heavy guns to make your point. Skip meals to catch up sleep. Eat on the road with some take out orders, filled while the folks eat. If this takes too long, lower your expectations. Not really, but you are grouchy, a sign of fatigue. Maybe you should save energy holding your tongue.<br> <br> A medical answer, 8 to 9 hours sleep at a minimum for some average CFer.

" Yep I need a lot of sleep. 8-10 hours minimum on normal days and it quickly increases with significant activity or decreased health. Can go one or two nights with less but it quickly catches up with me. <br> Depending on where you are at with your health CF is tiring on the body, activity counts double and our bodies need the recoverytime. <br> <br> Trips are wonderful especially active ones but you do need the rest. Nothing much to do about that. If not you simply stop functioning after a few days or get actually sick. When traveling with a group they either have to keep you in consideration or you could skip a day and rest at the hotel. <br> <br> Went to Norway recently and on active trips like that I get up early-ish, 6 or 7 and then Im active through the day. (Walk, travel, see things) But then I have no choice but to head back to the hotel after dinnertime and try to be in bed with lights out at 9 or so in the evening. Who cares, had a great trip where all went well and all that I really missed out on were the drunk Norwegian women at night. .. ohh "

" Has anyone coughed up tissue from their lungs before? This is a first for me and it is a little disturbing. "
5439
" You should be telling this to your CF Specialist!!!! "
9620
" I spoke with the RN who says it is probably sputum. However I am a nurse too and it doesnt look like it to me. They said just keep an eye on it to see if there are any changes. Maybe I am just worrying too much. "
5439
" How did it look like if you dont mind me asking? I coughed up something weird a while back and still not sure what it was. It was hard, dark brown, and large as a pebble and foul tasting. "
9249
" That was probably some old sputum with blood mixed in. The nurse at the cf clinic was saying that the sputum can be so dry the are hard as pebbles. <br> Mine was pink and soft like your skin tissue, kind of oval with a pointy sort of edge and when I squeezed it it just moved though my fingers I guess. I could not squeeze it flat. It kept the same shape, nothing squeezed put of the shape. "
5439
" If it continues, have it tested. "

" I assume you arent describing a hemoptysis. As an adult, most of my CF issues have been GI. Even still, I dont catch colds, if something nails my lungs it is serious. About a year ago I was fighting a non specific lung infection when I hocked up a marble sized blood clot. It happened at a moment when I sneezed, coughed and maybe belched at once. I figured the last place it would have come from was my lungs so I went about an ENT and GI check waiting to see my CF pulmonologist. <br> <br> Although it was essentially over and done with by the time I saw the doctor who knew from whence my clots came, I had a collection of individual clots, kept separate, cold and annotated as about the only remaining evidence of pleural effusion. Having been through the usual sinus surgeries and the indignitiy of canker mouth, I know bloody sputem from other tissue types. Not to mention I keep a little of my lung in a jar so I sort of know what the alveoli tissue would be like. As a Nurse, my guess is you know exactly what you have in your hand. <br> <br> The short of it for me was momentary terror when the second hemoptysis happened. There was no doubt it came from my lungs and it was punctuated by the most exquisite pain above my left kidney. The pain was shocking in the literal sense. Although momentary, less than a second, the pain caused my entire body to wretch and spasm wildy. Most hemoptysis in CF isnt from pleural effusion rather the ravages of lung infection and so forth. <br> <br> Exactly what I had in hand was clearly a formed blood clot, now surrounded by a layer of mucus. It easily could have been lung tissue holding some or all of the collected stuff together. As it turns out, the origin was such that lung tissue shouldnt have been in what I brought up. Without a doubt if you can, save it. It didnt occur to me at the time but now I wish I had sectioned one of my clots. I am a semi-retired research geneticist and I often culture and identify my own infections and such. From the pink nature and the tissue like cohesive structure, it could be a chunk of lung.<br> <br> I had never known that the granular crap that ends up being crunched unwittingly between my teeth to be dried mucus. That is a new one. I had always assumed that they were crysalis formed in the lungs that encapsulate resistant infections as in TB historically. This is a little out of school, but at a very young age, I was tutored through through human anatomy. My tutor called me in one early morning to get a peek at a tuburcular lung. Crysali encapsulate the pockets of TB bacteria. Most of them were small but I could see where so many little granules combined to make a golf ball sized rock laying in the collaped lung tissue.<br> <br> The term &quot,foul tasting&quot, must be faint praise. I cant honestly say my cruchies have been remarkable but from the moment that chest was opened, I have an olfactory memory that endures to this day. This is actually a fantastic mechanism the body had developed to deal with intractable infection. Without this ability to entomb an infectious mass, TB and so many other diseases would have been quickly fatal. Next time you gag on a crysalis, thank your parents for the great genes to make a carbunkle. You dont see that term so often now but a lot of atheletes know carbunkles well. Somebody injures the soft tissue in a joint, infection gets in where the blood cant and boom you have an incurable infection. After a few months you begin to notice that a bulge is below one knee cap and not the other. Enter encapsulation of the infection.<br> <br> LL "

" I love music...not talented in it, but LOVE to listen to lyrics and the beat. When my doctor retired back maybe 15ish years ago (when CFers could still hang out) we had a big party for him. They played &quot,Hero&quot, by Mariah Carey. So that song has a very special memory for me.<br> <br> Also, &quot,My wish for you&quot, by Rascall Flatts. It was popular when my friend Kay got her tx (she later passed away). It always makes me think of her. "

" Ive seen some mention of the issue of vaginal mucus before in general and that its &quot,thicker&quot, in cf patients, but Im not sure if thats what Im seeing or if its something else. Frequently (around once or twice a day if it occurs), but not daily, I notice a big glob of mucus like a plug that is chosing to exit my body. I typically notice it after peeing, but it seems like this size of a thing would show up even if it came out at a different time. <br> <br> This is not just a little line of mucus. Im talking the size of those big round gumballs you get out of machines if you took the plug and rolled it into a ball. It is very sticky, but definitely seems connected like a certain &quot,defined plug&quot,. I have asked the gyn about it, and she said &quot,thats just cf&quot,, but Im not sure if shes basing this off of anything other than she knows I have them, she knows I have cf, therefore they are just cf. <br> <br> These plugs dont seem to be a problem of any sort and do not appear to accompany respiratory infections or anything, they just seem so extreme (and not like something Ive heard of) that I thought it was worth checking with yall.<br> <br> Guess lubrication will probably never be a problem - lol "

" I never had that. Ask your doctor if you can culture it next time you see it.

" dear anonymous - does it happen all of the time? If it is occasional, you might try charting when it happens. My mucus at ovulation was often like rubber cement - a blob in my underwear. The ovulation mucus happens about two weeks before your period comes - a great predictor if your periods are irregular. "
2483
" I used to have that happen to me sometimes. It only happend once a month and I only happen probably 5 or 6 times. But it hasnt happened in about 2 12 years, so I really dont know what it was. "
1972
" p.s. this mucus is likely coming from the cervix. Cervical mucus changes through the cycle in response to changing estrogenprogesterone levels. When estrogen is high, just before ovulation, it can keep sperm alive for up to five days. I have taught a method of birth control that is based on observing these changes, and others, during the cycle - Natural Family Planning. "
2483
" I get what Momtana is describing and consider it a normal part of CF. Interestingly, it stopped while I was on the birth control pill. Ive been doing the charting that Momtana describes and am finding the rubber cement visits on exactly the 22 day after the start of my period. This month I am tracking my ovulation with a urine sample and Im eager to see if my LH level increases around the time of this discharge which would link it to ovulation...which Im sure it has to do with just the question remains .... am I ovulating. "
1832
" Lauren, When do you get your period after the day 22 mucus discharge? Ovulation happens 14 days (plus or minus) before your period comes - if this mucus comes around then it is a good indicator of fertility and ovulation. Let me know if you have any questions ..... I have been teaching cycle stuff for a long time and it still interests me, especially now in light of CF. Do you also take your temperature -with the basal body thermometer?? - its a great way to know when you ovulated. "

Every morning this week Ive noticed DSs breath smells different -- like he has a sinus infection. But his nose is clear, no cough, just had cultures run and nothing growing.... Yesterday got his afternoon meds ready and caught a whiff from the bottle of vitamins. Yep, nasty aquadeks smell. Least I know what it is now. But, bleah! "

" They taste even worse than they smell. And if you have even a small burn after taking them...oh boy. I havent been on those vitamins in a little over six months.

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently. Since I had been spending more time with her and being around her more and more, and making my continual interest in her very apparent, she thought I needed to know despite the risk of losing me (she thought I might not want to deal with it). When she told me that she was diagnosed as an infant and about the disease I told her I still wanted to continue our relationship and that I was glad she told me.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

" Aaron:<br> <br> Im 73 and I have CF. In September we celebrated our 51st Wedding Anniversary.<br> <br> My advise to you would be to treat her as you would any other, non CF, woman. Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

Dont make CF a huge deal, but dont ignore it either. There are plenty of things you could do to support your GF with CF. <br> <br> *Offer to come to dr. appointments<br> *pick up her meds for her<br> *be general moral support<br> *run in 5K or half marathon and raise funds for CF<br> <br> *(Most important): Just &quot,be there&quot,.

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at 44 following a pneumonia. Had always gotten bronchitis once or twice a winter but was only hospitalized once when I was 26.

Looking back, I am surprised that our pediatrician did not sweat test me but I dont spend much time wondering why he didnt even when I missed 30 days of school in first grade. My husband and I have four kids, none of whom have cf and I suspect if I had been diagnosed earlier that our family would have been smaller and my life would have been more limited.

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

" I had orientation for my new job last Monday. Out of 25 people, of course my seat was right net to the sick girl. I sat down and she was coughing like crazy. She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time. Just got done doing the vest and already feeling a lot better. I just hate to cough in public when it sounds so bad : "
8261
" Ugh, other than increasing vest treatments, maybe some targeted CPT on the areas you have issues, increase fluids to get that crud up and out. Get sleep. And maybe a call into the clinic to see if they can prescribe something based on previous cultures. "
2230
" Yeah, thats mostly what ive been doing. I think that is what helped me get better so quick. I woke up today and its almost gone. A lot better then yesterday when I was in class and the lungs were gurgling. I was using the antibiotics as a last result. Basically, if I wasnt showing improvement daily I would take them. If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine. When I was around this girl, my immune system was already not well from lack of sleep and being around another sick person a week prior. I knew I would get it, so at least I was able to prepair. Thanks for your help! "
8261
" only thing that works for me is a nebulizer with meds "
12077
" Double or Quadruple pulmozyme treatments. Sleep. Lots of fluids. And, if I am experiencing a stubborn chest infection, RUNNING. No other air clearance like it. Hope you feel better soon! "
1065
" It wont help with your infection, but you might make a benign example of the non sick person &quot,working&quot, through herhis bug. Then carry masks to offer to the next non sick person. If they refuse, take out another one and put it on. Oh, make sure your mask has a ridiculous smile drawn on it just for the occasion. You dont need to advertise your CF, but nothing wrong in asking for some consideration.<br> <br> LL "
12928
" Ugh. I wish I would of just moved away from the girl and bee &quot,rude.&quot, I have never coughed up so much mucus in my life. Antibiotics might be my next step. I felt like I was getting better but its just not going away. I swear I know the smell of staph. Maybe Im crazy, but I swear I can smell it in my lungs when Im taking a shower. Ugh! I think Im going to try running tomorrow. "
8261
" You can probably appreciate this scenario. I was hosting an extracurricular activity recently and one of the kids (over 10 yrs old--not a toddler) spent the 1.5 hrs sniffling, wiping his nose and licking his hands and fingers. That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "
14928
" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "
4585
" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "

" I wonder how this will affect those of us who have had a transplant &amp, are unable to work. VIVA OBAMACARE! "

" I hated the smell and taste as well. The adult ADEK pills are also very large so not fun to swallow. My doctor said I could instead take one Flintstones vitamin and a vitamin E. Im not sure what the equivalent is for a childs dose. "
12507
" Fortunately he doesnt seem to mind the smell. Im primarily concerned that he get adequate Vitamin D and adeks is comparable to Source CF, whereas Vitamax is severely lacking in most of the fat solubles -- not really sure why its even considered a CF vitamin. He takes two adeks softgels a day, plus a vitamin E (400 IU), vitamin A (10,000 IU) daily and a 5 mg tablet of vitamin K (mephyton) weekly. I figured if it became an issue, Id speak with his doctor about comparable vitamins. Im just glad I figured out it was the vitamin causing his breath to smell, was worried he had a sinus or other infection. "

" You guys had me all freaked out re a brewing battle to come when we had to change over last week when we used our last CF Source. DS took without an issue. Might be because he had for 0 - 1 year old until they swithced. or bc he wouldnt chew a chewable so I had to crush and add water and it would take like 20 ml to get it down as oppose to the now 2 ml. "
13361
" My daughter was on Aquadeks a couple of years ago and we noticed a strange (bad) smell coming from her. She was in 5th grade and it was just sweating out of her. It took us awhile to figure out it was the vitamins. I took one sniff od the cap and realized it was the same smell. Since we can no longer get Source CF she has to take the Vitamax chewables which she hates but not as much as smelling bad. Weird thing is that my son who also took the Aquadeks, didnt have the same reaction that his sister did. "

" Im not talking about FEV1 needed to be considered for evaluation, but to actually be transplanted. I live in the Netherlands and I was informed today that only patients with an FEV1 of 20 or below 20% are able to get organs due to shortage of organs!<br> <br> Thanks for your input.<br> <br> Vera 29<br> Netherlands "
1032
" I am in Canada and have 24% lung function and have been on the list just over a year.<br> <br> Dave, "
3323
" Thanks Dave. And you could get lungs anytime since youve been on the list right? Here they have 2 lists: the normal list and the high urgency list. Only people in the high urgency list can get lungs and those have to be really sick and close to dying. "
1032
" Hoi Vera, <br> <br> Those numbers arent set in stone here. It depends on your decline and general health. <br> They make sense though as a general guideline. Because getting a transplant is rather risky in itself and then theres the risk of rejection and further complications. Something you only want to do at a point where you are running out of options. <br> At a stable 30% I really would not want to have a transplant personally. <br> Also because I know people that were in their 20%s for maybe ten years before going the transplant route. <br> And I know people that were in fast decline at much higher fev1% and also went the transplant route so it just depends. <br> <br> Anyway lets compare the Netherlands to America, and to Canada while Im at it. <br> <br> About 17 million people here and about 60 lungtransplants done here in the Netherlands a year. (looking to rise to atleast 80 or more on the very short term thanks to some machine making donorlungs better suited before going in. But thats besides the point for the comparison.) <br> About 320 million people in America and about 1600 lungtransplants done in America a year. <br> About 35 million people in Canada and I can find about 160 done in 2006. <br> <br> So thats about one in 280.000 people a year here in the Netherlands.<br> About one in 200.000 people a year in America. <br> And about one in 220.000 people a year in Canada. <br> <br> Not a shockingly huge difference Im afraid. Shortage of organs is everywhere and quite similarly so. "

" Hi twistofchaos. I think the numbers you chose for comparison purposes are not too relevant. What really matters is the number of people that are on the transplant list against those who get a transplant. The number of people in a country is not too relevant in this case. <br> Based on research I have been doing lately, I can tell you that last year there were already 80 people who received a lung transplant throughout the Netherlands, against 194 people on the list. This is lung transplants alone. This means that 41% of the people waiting for lungs got a transplant in 2012. <br> <br> I also read that for the US, an average of 1400 people are on the lung transplant list, on average, per year, and there are around 1200 people who receive organs. I am not 100% sure about these numbers though because I got the information from different sources. <br> <br> What I said about people needing to be very very sick to get lungs here in the NL is, however, true. Doctors, nurses and physiotherapists alike have all been informing me that due to shortage of organs (especially lungs), people only get on the high urgency list when they only have a few weeks to live. When I compare this scenario to what I hear from the US, it definitely sounds worse here because I have heard of a lot of cases where people go on the list in the US and have the possibility to get called for a lung transplant when theyre still &quot,out and about&quot,. Obviously they are also very sick, and there are still a lot of people who die while waiting for a transplant, but it does sound more gloomy for us in the Netherlands.<br> <br> One last thing is that I was also recently informed that even though the transplant allocation method here in the NL is changing and finally adopting the US allocation method, which has been proving more efficient, Holland is still working with both, which means that some people are falling through the cracks because they are still under the old method.<br> For example, a girl suffering from CF that used to go to my clinic was on the high urgency list, but then the next day they did some more tests and decided that she was no longer on the high urgency list. She passed away the following day. This was due to confusion caused by using the 2 methods (it takes a few years to fully transition to the US allocation method). This occurred just last month. Sad, but true. "

" Hiya, <br> <br> Its relevant if you want to figure out how many transplants are actually done on people with CF. <br> I agree ofcourse that the whole transplant system has to be hugely improved, and mainly that donorship has to be the default for everyone till one objects and some specific exceptions. Which would solve a lot and its something that is proposed every few years here in politics but never quite makes it. <br> <br> Anyway in the US 1 per 3700 people are born with CF. <br> In the Netherlands thats 1 per 4750. <br> <br> So help me figure out how more people with CF get transplanted when you dont have a huge increase in transplants especially compared to the higher % of people with CF in the population. <br> Fewer people get screenedgo on the transplantlists in the US at all? "

" I maintain that out of everyone waiting for a transplant in the US and in the NL, in the US they have a higher chance of receiving one. Not only do the numbers speak for themselves (I stated those in a previous reply), but just the fact that people in the US are able to receive lungs for a period of over 1 year or 2 and still be alive (a lot of them) at the end of that period shows that the chances there are higher. Like I said, in the NL you can be on the normal list for years but you will not get lungs while you are on that list. This is something that all doctors have confirmed to me. Due do shortage, you only get on the high urgency list (when you are finally able to receive lungs if they become available) when you are extremely sick and close to death. <br> I was also informed that due to my height (53&quot,), it will be even harder for me to get lungs that are suitable in the Netherlands because everyone is much taller than me. This presents another problem. "
1032
" Ok, <br> <br> About 4 million people are born in America a year. (some would call them babies)<br> In the Netherlands about 190.000 people are born a year. (some would call them gorgeous studs) <br> <br> Ignoring immigration, because who knows whats going on there and atleast both countries have plenty of that so. <br> <br> 4 million  1 per 3700 people = 1081 people are born with CF a year in the US. <br> 190.000  1 per 4750 people = 40 people are born with CF a year in the Netherlands. <br> <br> 1600 transplants a year with 1081 people born with CF a year = 1.48 times as many transplants. <br> 60 transplants a year with 40 people born with CF a year = 1.5 times as many transplants.<br> <br> Sure everything is much better in the US but their transplantrate seems fairly identical. <br> <br> You say here the waitinglist is more than twice as big as the transplantrate but in America its almost one on one. Then what gives? Thats not cynical, Im curious. <br> They were doing transplants in the US earlier (1969) but weve been doing them for a while here as well (1990, and since 2001 in 3 locations) so Im not sure how in 2013 we still have a 200+% demand here but not in the US. <br> <br> Anyway but my parents always saved a lot and me and my sister were indeed raised from early age with the idea to save money if one day we had to go to the US (or another country) if we would need a transplant. To be able pay for it ourselves. Still always live with that idea when it comes to spending money and so CF turned me into a terrible cheapskate. That by the way counts his savings at night in the dark with nothing but a flickering candleflame softly laughing with always suddenly a thunderstorm over my house out of nowhere when I do that. Weird. "

" Youre still focusing on the total number of people with cf and newborns etc, and not on the number of people on a transplant list at any given time. It doesnt matter if 1000 people are born with cf or not, what matters is how many of those will be on the transplant list at the same time (as far as what my question is, Im sure your numbers count towards different studies). "

" Yes because how many people you put on a transplantlist is quite arbitrary and I rather wish to know how many transplants are actually done. but never mind that. "

" IN THE NEWS: Sarah Murnaghan, a ten-year old with cystic fibrosis, needs a lung transplant. She has weeks to live. Federal policy requires a child must be at least twelve years old to be on the adult transplant list. Sarah wont live to twelve without the transplant.Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Kathleen Sebelius, has asked for a review of the policy but has said it will takes years to make any changes. The HHS Chief of Staffs telephone number is 202690-8157. I called to voice my opinion and they transferred me to a hot-line for the Office of the Secretary where I was permitted to leave a message. I dont know that it will help Sarah, but it was worth a try. I encourage you to call and voice your opinion. "

" Well, we are getting a good first glimpse of Obamacare.<font color=\\#333333\\\"> Kathleen Sebelius could waive the age rule for this girl but she has decided not to. The fact that one person has that much power over someones life is horrifying. <br> <br> <font>http:thinkprogress.orghealth201306052104921sarah-murnaghan-denied-lung-transplant \""
5003
" This has nothing to do with &quot,Obamacare&quot, - this has everything to do with the organ allocation system. Sebelius could have waived the rule - she chose not to interfere and allow the people with a more in-depth knowledge of this situation make their judgment. She knows that there are medical professionals and others staffing committees at UNOSOPTN with a much greater understanding of the entire situation and she chose to trust them - one might have thought that would have given Judge Baylson pause, but it did not. His action set precedence, and probably not a good one for us. Now, when someone is not satisfied with a particular listing situation and they have power, through wealth, influence, or media spouting accurate or false information - they will lawyer-up and muddy the waters. This will not be a good outcome in the longer term future. And it should be remembered - this is not simply about saving the life of a 10-year-old girl - this is about choosing who lives and who dies... The lungs that may be directed to Sarah will be at the expense of the person to whom they were destined. That person very well may not get another chance... Adult lungs given to Sarah will not fit, and will have to be transplanted partially. Taking lobes off lungs for transplant complicates the surgery markedly and reduces Sarahs chances of survival, and longer term survival. The allocation algorithms look not only at level of illness, but at likelihood of survival. Giving adult lungs to a child with a riskier surgery and statistically lower survival rate, versus giving them to an adult with a markedly survival rate and lower risk surgery, might seem to be an inappropriate use of a rare resource. The decision here needs to be whether to save a child, or whether to save an adult - and that adult may be a father, a mother, a sole wage earner in a family - with the knowledge that the better match is the adult - that is the decision that also must be considered. Love, Steve "

" Obviously this girls doctors thought she was an acceptable candidate for adult lungs its just her age that caused the issue and a technicality like that shouldnt decide if a person lives or dies. Its just an example that one size rules do not fit all. And whats even more concerning is the CFFs lack of advocacy I mean even if they were against this girl getting a transplant Id like to hear them say it. They are our biggest advocate and yet they stayed silent. Even in the response they put out they say they want to leave the decision between the doctor and patient. Well, the doctor and patient thought this girl should have a transplant and this one rule stopped them. "
5003
" I know this is a very sensitive issue but has anyone considered that the &quot,age&quot, rule was developed in 2005. I dont think it should be about age as much as body size and mass. Lung transplantation is very tricky, much more difficult than a kidney or liver. A kidney is placed in the open abdominal cavity and the liver usually only a lobe is used- like a pancreas. Lungs depend a lot on size and shape - architecture of the donor and recipient. I have not heard from many transplant people on this particular case. All I have understood is that in this case, if adult lungs are used they will need to be &quot,Modified&quot,. I worked many years for a major transplant center, in the renal division though, and I never heard of modifying lungs. I have cf, my wife lost both parents, when they were each quite young to kidney failure, her opinion simply is that organ donation should be the default on our drivers license rather than not donating as the default. In other words if for some religious or other reason you did not want to be an organ donor you would have sign off. Is this case just about age or about the disgraceful lack of organ donors in general? "

" Three of the past four days, Ive woken up with a sharp pain under the lower part of my right rib cage, more toward my back than front. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and knows what it is. Its not my usual lung-related pain, because its not worse when I inhale, and my mucus is about the same. I did have a low fever and aches one of the days, but am not sure if thats relevant. <br> <br> So, in the morning, I wake up and the pain is maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but once Im up-up, its like a 0-3. And by three or four pm, its completely gone--UNLESS (heres the weird thing) I swallow a big bite of food. A few seconds after swallowing, I get a flash of pain in the area.<br> <br> Im not nauseous or having out of the ordinary GI symptoms. Im exercising like normal too--went rock climbing one of the days and did zumba another. Lying down and pushing my back into the floor makes it hurt more. So I was thinking a muscle thing, but the food-swallow thing is odd.<br> <br> Any ideas? "

" My first thought was gallstones as well, but it is possible that it could be pleurisy.<br> <br> I had my gallbladder removed about 8 years ago. I didnt have stabbing back pain or anything - BUT back pain on the right side below the shoulder is common with gallstones and gallbladder issues. I would get symptoms similar to anxiety attacks, tightness in my chest and pain when I would try to breathe. I would also get nausea and vomiting as time passed. For my I had attacks and symptoms directly related to drinking soda or any carbonated beverage. That being said a lot of people get symptoms when they eat, but symptoms and attacks are often associated with eating fatty foods or greasy foods. <br> <br> I hope it is nothing and that it goes away, but I would definitely bring it up to your doc and ask if they can check it out if it continues. As for pleurisy it is usually a result of infection but just because you arent coughing more or dont have excess mucus doesnt mean anything. If you have an infection and any area of the lung tissue is inflamed it can result in pleurisy.<br> <br> Hope you start feeling better soon. "

Unfortunately he fell asleep but woke at 3 am ready to start his day. He now takes a very low dose of clonidine (0.2 mg). That helps him fall asleep, stay asleep, and not feel groggy or foggy the next day. I would suggest trying the melintonin first. You can get it any pharmacy.

" I didnt know that my girlfriend had Cystic Fibrosis for several weeks, just until recently.

" I think your post is great. Good questions. I am a mother of a 3 yr old little girl with CF. She is just beginning her journey, but I appreciate what you wrote, knowing she will experience the same situations when she is old enough for dates. (Maybe like 40... just kidding) She told you because she trusts you, she likes you. Im sure she does not want you to act differently. But I do think it is a good idea to ask her to teach you how her treatments are done, from beginning to end. If you do have a long future together, this will help you, her and those that love her, to have confidence in you being able to help her in those times she can not help herself. I would learn &quot,hand CPT.&quot, It is like her vest but done by hand and helps a lot more mucus come out. It is something she can not do by herself. If you become even more serious I would accompany her to a clinic appt. You can learn a lot there. If it is okay with her of course. <img src=\\imagessmilieswink.png\\\" border=\\\"0\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" title=\\\"Wink\\\" class=\\\"inlineimg\\\"> God Bless you guys. \""

Tell her that you want to be close and assist as much as she will let you. Volunteer to go to the CF Clinic on one, or more, of her visits.<br> <br> Lastly, be happy that you have such a wonderful woman in your life.<br> <br> Best of everything to both of you,<br> <br> Bill "

" Ill agree...this is her &quot,normal&quot,, even though it is brand new to you. When my son was first diagnosed, we went to visit his cousins. At first they stared at his vest like he was an alien, and then he let them try it on, told them it felt like a massage. He takes it with him to sleepovers and uses it when his friends come here. He made it their normal. Hes gotten really slick about sliding enzymes in his mouth at the table without anyone noticing. If I see someone stare, I distract them with conversation, so that might help her- surrounding her with more &quot,normal&quot,. She sounds active, thats the best thing for her. Also find activities that you can do with her that are indoors so she can do treatments and not feel like she should be entertaining you instead. Cards, chess, movies, etc. Nothing makes me happier than when I go to tell my son that dinner is ready and hes on the couch with his buddy, vest on, playing video games. Theres just no problem with it- its comfortable, normal. Ask questions so you understand it, but dont grill her about it. It could freak her out and make her feel like you are with her to &quot,save&quot, her instead of with her for her. If shes in good health now and keeps up her good habits, shell grow old and wise like Bill. wink wink! "

" Ive had two vastly different experiences with coughing up blood. The first set of experiences lasted 4 years. Every three months, I would cough up a large amount of blood soaked mucus, anywhere from a half a cup to a cup. Once I coughed up even more than that over a 24 hour period. <br> <br> The second set of experiences sounds more like what youre having now. Ill randomly cough up a teaspoon to a tablespoon of just blood. Unfortunately, because of my first experiences, I have panic attacks anytime I taste blood, but Ive learned that one if these episodes, as long as it is isolated and stops immediately, isnt too serious. Keep letting your doctors know. I was always told to stop all treatments, vest and inhaled meds (except antibiotics) for 24 hours. Then start up pulmo if you take it. 48 hours after coughing up blood, if there hasnt been any more, start doing airway clearance again.<br> <br> Hope this helps. "

" I was diagnosed at age 41. I was pretty healthy when I was younger. Maybe a croupy kind of cough that my mother always thought sounded funny, but we never gave it a thought. I was very active in sports and exercise back then and that is still the case today. For a good decade before I was diagnosed I would cough up a bunch of junk. I would cough up a little blood here and there too. Thought it was just allergies or something. In 2005, I had a bad case of pneumonia and was diagnosed with bronchiectasis. They tested me for cf carrier and I was positive. But they never did the full mutation panel testing after that! My pulmonologist at that time dropped the ball. There were other conditions that I shared with him that looking back should have said to him , &quot,this person probably has cf&quot,. He should have done more investigation. All he wanted to do is CT scans and cut out the bad portions of my lung. I said, Im out of here. I continued struggling coughing up junk and having terrific pains in my lungs every now and then and coughing up a little blood here and there. I would get sinus infections somewhat frequently. I would take some antibiotics every so often and things would improve for a bit. But things continued to get worse. Finally, a few months before I was diagnosed I had a very bad bout of hemoptysis. A lot of blood. That scared me and I needed to look into things further. It just so happens that I have a dear friend of mine that has cf (I consider her my sister in every sense of the word). She suggested that I go to her cf clinic and get checked out. After a sweat test, it showed I had cf. They then did the full mutation panel testing which revealed my two mutations. Now Im in good hands with the right doctor at my cf clinic. "

We did a gene test and here it was - one mild and one more aggressive gene. I was a classic case for &quot,adult cf&quot, as it never showed at birth or during my early childhoodteenage years.<br> Over the years sports helped me to stay healthy overall.<br> Since I was diagnosed I am in better health than ever - very proactive, I listen to my body more than every (when it calls for rest, I do rest) and I am very diligent with my meds and inhalations.<br> And, no, I never got pregnant but we adopted two wonderful boys who are the love of my life (plus my very supportive husband :-) "

She turned me to me and said &quot, this is the end of my illness, dont worry you wont get sick.&quot, I was thinking &quot,yeah right, I know a cough when I hear one.&quot, By Wed I was sick, very sick, fever and all. I went to the health food store and picked up some natural wellness pills. By Friday I was almost back to normal, but I could hear the nasty bronchitis. Every day, I do notice that I am getting better, but I need it to go away quicker. I can not afford to take time off work or miss any school since I already missed two days due to this. When I say the girl who got me sick last Friday, she was in the bronchitis stage also. Thats how I knew for sure it was the same illness. My bronchitis is worse of course due to CF. I even had my lungs gurgling in class today. I had to keep going to the bathroom because I did not want to cough in class. I would gross everyone out if I did. To the point, does anyone have any advice to get rid of bronchitis. I dont get sick often, but this is the worse bronchitis Ive had in some time.

If Im around someone who is sick, and Ive been getting good sleep and rest, Im fine.

That is not a typo. Licking! I told him to wash his hands twice, but it was hopeless. "

" I just rejoined back here at cf.com and if Im not supposed to post this, Ennio, just remove it and send me a message.<br> <br> It just became public knowledge 48 hrs ago that Obamacare has a revision underway to change the qualification for Medical Disability for Respiratory Illness. I cant remember how it was worded, but it was something to that extent. <b>We only have TODAY to act and appeal. <b> <br> <b><font color=\\#333333\\\"><br> Please take the time to comment here. Even if you dont have cf. We need to stress that CF is such a time consuming disease and there is no way to work and take care of ourselves properly.

" They will no longer consider physician interventions that are outpatient or ER visits. They will no longer count for the 6 treatments that qualified in a year previously. Im just hoping that I will still qualify because there is no way that I can work. "

" I think the problem, the way I understand it, is that they will no longer count home IVs as an intervention. They are saying that if it can be treated at home, it is not severe enough to count. This, IMO, is flawed logic. Many CFers do home IVs whenever possible to avoid the germs of the hospital, to get better rest etc. It does not mean they are less sick than someone else who would be treated inpatient for a similar exacerbation. I recently did home IVs after a virus kicked off a nasty exacerbation where I lost 20% lung function. We chose home IVs in order to not expose me to other viral illnesses that were rampant at the time. So, in Social Securitys eyes under this new impairment listing, that 4 weeks of IV antibiotics and 20% loss of lung function would not have been considered an intervention because I was not hospitalized. Yikes. <br> <br> Also, I didnt see it specifically mentioned, but Im assuming then that they are no longer considering the need for nebulized antibiotics as an intervention. <br> <br> If Im reading these changes correctly it will hurt many CFers that are currently on, or going to apply for SSDI. Someone please correct me if Im wrong!<br> <br> Autumn 32 wCF "

" I think you are right, Autumn. Im on week 5 of home IVs after a short ICU stay to desensitize. I think Ive been just as sick as many who are hospitalized.<br> <br> I was told by other CFers on FB that nebulized meds no longer will count, as well as ER trips, which is just nuts.<br> <br> this is very scary. Everyone needs to go to that link and speak up before midnight! I dont know what Ill do if I lose my disability. "
14928
" I agree Debra, it is scary. I was approved for SSDI 4 years ago and actually am currently under a review. I am beyond nervous and thinking about what we will do financially if I lose it. Under the guidelines they are looking to change to I would definitely not qualify at this point. Ugh. "
